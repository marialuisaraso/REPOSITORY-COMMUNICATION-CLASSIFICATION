terminal: allow the find widget to work in detached terminals
terminal: allow the find widget to work in detached terminals

- Abstracts some methods to an `IAnyTerminalInstance` interface that
  is common between attached and detached terminal instances.
- Some minor changes in the find contribution to make it work with
  detached instances after that.
- Make the find widget track the `activeFindWidget` since commands
  previously depended on the active terminal, which is not tracked for
	detached terminals (the alternative would be making the active
	terminal instance tracker also track detached terminals)

And then it 'just works' in the test results terminal
