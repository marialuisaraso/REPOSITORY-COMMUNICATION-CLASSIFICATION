It also might not be. Yall are doing your own thing and trying to formulate a plan and that's good, I'd just like to submit this and maybe it will be helpful.\r\n\r\nPlease excuse the ranting tone. It's early in the morning and I've been reading too much political news.\r\n\r\n-------------------\r\n\r\nFirst, I think using the term “map” is problematic since it implies that you can get to or achieve the waypoints. All of these things are more “directions” than destinations.\r\n\r\nNext, I don’t like the idea of splitting up “backend” and “frontend”. \r\n\r\nI think the standard definitions that people use for this stuff are hugely problematic. If you define HTML/CSS/JS as “front end” where does that leave someone who works on the iOS app for let’s say “simple.com”? Are they not a “web developer” even though they are building something that is equivalent to the website? What about someone who is working in a python templating language that spits out html/css? Where do they fall? I can keep coming up with examples.\r\n\r\nFurther, I think that exclusively focusing on one over another can be harmful. In terms of job prospects, you’re going to have a *lot* more problems getting a job at a smaller company if you can’t work the full stack.\r\n\r\nWorse, it is harmful for learning. A humongous part of programing on the web is really internalizing how the web/HTTP/etc works. This is the “in between” stuff that you’re only going to learn by studying the whole process simultaneously.\r\n\r\nPersonally I prefer to talk about things functionally than as tech. “Back-end developer” to indicate how good someone is at understanding system architecture, performance, databases, and security; and “front-end developer” to indicate to what degree someone thinks about human-computer interaction, responsiveness, UI optimization and reusability, browsers, responsiveness, and accessibility. When you formulate definitions this way you start seeing these as two largely orthogonal dimensions of a square, rather than anything mutually exclusive.\r\n\r\nNow about specifics. I’ll just work my way down the chart with random comments.\r\n\r\n* Splitting HTML learning from CSS is weird. I’d say learn them at the same time - there’s basically nothing to HTML oherwise (except forms)\r\n* Javascript _is_ es6, stop drawing a distinction and just read an essay on its history\r\n* Task runners? Gulp? Why? \r\n* Don’t bother with Flux\r\n* React Angular _and_ vue? How many rabbit holes do you want to simultaneously go down? You don’t know angular because you ran through the tutorial. It’s a huge subject\r\n* Don’t bother with Yarn until you need it\r\n* Testing should be its own thing. Specifically TDD. If you learn the tool you won’t do testing and you _definitely_ will not do it to its full potential. You need to learn the philosophy.\r\n* Typescript - whatever, sure, do or do not\r\n* How is “Responsive Web” different from just CSS?\r\n* CSS Framework? Don’t waste your time learning bootstrap. Just learn modern CSS - get comfortable with flexbox, understand the _underlying concepts_ and you’ll be fine. There aren’t all that many that you can’t learn them in a week.\r\n* Preprocessors? Fine, but I feel like LESS is well…less overhead while learning\r\n* Deep dive CSS3..first of, CSS3 has been out forever, it’s just CSS now. Being aware of the fancy stuff is fine and you can look it up as needed. If you just learn the basics you’ll be able to guess pretty well what features CSS has or doesn’t\r\n* SVG is cool, d3 isn’t necessary and isn’t really tied to SVG at all, they’re just often used together but either is often used separately.\r\n* SVG is something you can spend 2 days on, get the basics, and come back to  as needed\r\n* Javascript design patterns. Huh? How do you write your code without designing it? You have to think of that stuff from the outset. Also the Javascript Design Patterns book is bad and I dono’t like it\r\n* Regex is a core programming concept in general, not just JS. Spend a day on it, learn the type of thing that it does, then learn more as needed\r\n\r\nBackend:\r\n* Just looking at this you can feel the cognitive weirdness as it tries to recommend _all_ the backend platforms at once. This is due to this arbitrary “backend/frontend” breakdown, if the terms are to have any meaning they should be defined functionally as the type of thing you do and focus on, not tech.\r\n* Minimizing Java and C# is weird since those are the ones with the greatest demand (at least that I’ve seen)\r\n* How is “Web Server” a separate topic? What does that even mean? \r\n* What does “Restful APIS” mean?\r\n* SOLID, YAGNI, KISS are not something to just read up on at some point. YAGNI and KISS are vague guidance that you can just take as a mantra and repeat to yourself every hour. SOLID is an important thing to study that makes sense only after you’ve gotten comfortable with coding and are looking to reach the next level. Its not something that you want to “just pick up at some point”\r\n* Regular Expressions again! See my previous comments\r\n* Security/Authentication…I guess this really depends on what exactly you mean by learning it. If you learn how the web works (which a _lot_ of people don’t) you will be learning a lot on this front already\r\n* Storage - pick one RDBMS and just go with it. There’s plenty to learn there without jumping all over the place. Don’t pick Oracle...or probably MySql.\r\n* Why the _shit_ does everyone want to focus on MongoDb? Its an oorobooros which is only notable for the fact that it is used which it is only because it is notable.\r\n* GOF Design Patterns - you’ll want to get to that sometime sooner but also it depends on the language you’re using. They were written for Java and not all apply\r\n* Architectural patterns…like what exactly? Learn how?\r\n* “Give DDD a shot” flat out offends me. If that is your attitude _you will fail_. Let’s say you’re making a calendar app and want to “give DDD a shot” what does that even mean you do?\r\n* Also, for the love of all that is holy, if you _are_ doing DDD and reading the big DDD book - there are 2 important concepts; ubiquitous language and bounded contexts. For reasons that Eric Evans has since lamented he put the latter on chapter 17 which nobody ever gets to. Read those chapters.\r\n* Also on DDD. Don’t just think that using Repository pattern means you do DDD. In fact, with modern ORMs, you probably _shouldn’t_ use that pattern.\r\n* Learn different testing techniques. Yes but waaaay before this point"}, {'title': 'Why python only as a leaf?', 'body': 'Python is as important as node or php .\r\n\r\nHope add more roadmap of python .\r\n\r\n____\r\nI am a PHPer, and use python and node as well.

I\'d want to know they knew how to set up an SSL cert, and keep page load times under 3 seconds too.  I\'d want them to know how to build HTML emails.\r\n\r\nI\'d want to know that the dev knew something about some CMS system... if they know one they can learn another... but I\'d want to know they knew how to deploy and manage one of these systems.  Sort of the basics... set up automated backups, deploy changes to a live system that has a database, how APIs work, how to set up a DNS entry, how to set up cleaning scripts for building local environments that don\'t strip out customer email addresses, how to install a firewall... or run SQL queries... read error logs... simple knowledge of Unix command line... basic knowledge of what AWS services do.  Simple back-end and DevOps / SecOps stuff.  I sort of look at anyone who doesn\'t know WordPress or HubSpot or Drupal or some CMS as having never worked on any sort of marketing system before... and that would scare me off.\r\n\r\nI want every dev to at least understand where they can go to read about coding standards, and how to validate them.  Various services they can use to make sure their code isn\'t sloppy... how to do an effective code review.\r\n\r\nI\'d want them to know a bit about UX Design, and certainly know how to slice comps in Photoshop.  The don\'t have to know how to do Visual Design from scratch, but they should know the basics philosophies of "Don\'t Make Me Think" and how to give feedback to designers around points vs pixels and how to design for responsive layouts.\r\n\r\nI\'d want them to know the basics about Google Analytics / business performance tracking.  Optimizely, Marketo, something like that.  They don\'t have to be experts, but they should be able to read a report and figure out what\'s happening on a page... is it the UX, is it the site performance, or is it just that users aren\'t converting... and to get this they just need to know the basics around a "conversion funnel" and the paths for how user data is captured.\r\n\r\nIf they went down the eCommerce (just another kind of CMS, really), I\'d want them to know how to integrate with some basic services... email campaign service, payment gateway... these are fairly basic, but require understanding how to set up a local and various test / prod environments slightly different to utilize various service sandboxes.  I\'d want them to know the basics of PCI compliance.\r\n\r\nI\'d want them to know the basics of monitoring.  How to set up uptime monitors, how to set up content monitors, how to set up application performance monitors, system health monitors, security access checks...  Use of tools like New Relic... to figure out what pages need to be optimized... use of tools like Pingdom or Uptime Robot are pretty basic.... but you\'d be surprised how many "devs" coming out of these coding academies know nothing about them.\r\n\r\nAnyway my point with a lot of this is really just that you can\'t do Front-end without working knowledge of a few things in DevOps and Back-End.  Certainly I agree with lines and specialization, but I never met a Front-end Dev who only did Front-end and nothing else ever.  Front-end Devs typically are on the hook for making everything work... being able to diagnose where the issues are is key for them to be successful.\r\n\r\nAre your Balsamiq files posted somewhere?

If you reach out to me with a brief detail of why and how you would like\r\nto use this content, there is a good chance that I will allow you to use it. The reason\r\nbehind this strictness in the license is to stop the people who have been using these\r\nroadmaps in ill manners e.g. ripping people off with suggesting random affiliate links,\r\nredistributing these roadmaps just for the sake of monetizing the traffic.\r\n\r\nI have tried contacting you privately (few emails, few tweets) but since it\'s open source might as well do it publicly\r\n\r\nI currently teach some classes at a french university (not private)\r\n\r\nI thought the roadmap was a pretty good idea and I\'d like to include it in a project of mine, and then distribute it to students \r\n\r\nThe project would be open source, with the same licence as yours to be as compliant as possible. \r\n\r\nThe project itself is a website to display the roadmap in a canvas, instead of a PNG, and allow my users to click on the skills that they think they know, which would color the boxes in various colors depending on how they click, and user could export this as a PNG & a Json to share the state of their current knowledge with others. This could be useful for a number of things, including assessing before a class the current knowledge of students \r\n\r\nIt could have ads depending on hosting, or something else to cover the server costs (maybe sponsors if a company is interested...) so I think this falls under "commercial use" and is prevented by the licence unless I\'m given explicit permission from the licence holder\r\n\r\nSo I\'m coming here to ask for permission.

Some of its uses are in telecoms, banking, e-commerce, computer telephony and instant messaging. - https://www.erlang.org/\r\n\r\nWhile initially built to tackle the requirements for the telecoms sector, we now have the same requirements for any (large scale) web application. Erlang comes with its own virtual machine (BEAM) and standard library (OTP) and is considered the most stable platform on the planet [[1]], running huge chunks of our internet, mobile phone and other telecommunications infrastructure.\r\n\r\nElixir makes the strengths of Erlang more accessible with a nicer syntax and handy additions on top.\r\nBoth [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/) and it's web framework [Phoenix](https://www.phoenixframework.org/) have been around and tested for quite some time and and there are tons of resources. Check out the Phoenix Framework web page to see the creation of a twitter-ish application including live UI updates across browsers in 15 minutes or [livebeats](https://livebeats.fly.dev/larshei).\r\n\r\nBy now, I have built a hand full web services with Elixir, and where things in other languages become difficult, erlang/elixir really shine (all those servers and services are clustered for example, without and extra tools). \r\n\r\nSome of the open source projects done by the community (and the community itself) are just awesome.\r\n\r\nElixir and Erlang are used by companies like\r\n- Discord\r\n- Ericson\r\n- Financial Times\r\n- Goldmann Sachs\r\n- PepsiCo\r\n- Pinterest\r\n- RabbitMQ -> itself powers a lot of the financial messaging on this planet\r\n- Solaris Bank\r\n- Spotify\r\n- WhatsApp\r\n- ...\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]: https://www.seppmed.de/elixir-zaubertrank-fuer-digitalisierung/\r\n"}, {'title': 'Add IOS developer roadmap', 'body': "<!--\r\nPlease do not remove anything written below.\r\n \r\nFill the details and open the issue.

I was wondering if we wanted to change the boxes, arrows, and text on any roadmap, do we need to edit the JSON file manually, e.g. `public/project/frontend.json`?\r\n\r\nIs there any tool to facilitate this?\r\n\r\nIn the contribution docs, it states `Please provide a rough textual roadmap with what you have in mind with an issue and we can take it from there`. But can we add new roadmaps on a local copy of the repo, without submitting an issue? To simply get it working locally then download an image with the roadmap.\r\n\r\nI know how to change the content of the nodes with markdown. Just asking about the JSON roadmap file 🙂.\r\n\r\nAny help is very much appreciated 👍,\r\nThanks!\r\n<!-- Please enter the issue details here -->\r\n"}, {'title': 'Backend roadmap jwt.io link not working as intended', 'body': "<!--\r\nPlease do not remove anything written below.\r\n \r\nFill the details and open the issue.

I'd like to suggest an additional item at the same level as GraphQL. I've been using Odata for many years now and this tool is as powerful as GraphQL can be. There are a couple of libs for FE to consume it and there is a very consolidated lib for C# to implement it. I know it's a more C# oriented solution, but I think it makes sense to be there. With that said, I think is a little bit more straightforward than GraphQL actually, once it's a well-implemented tool. However, the result of both is very similar.\r\nHere is a good document comparing both https://www.educba.com/odata-vs-graphql/\r\n\r\nWell, one more thought I think that could be helpful for everybody who likes this kind of solution.

Take for example this one: https://github.com/kripken/ammo.js/blob/main/ammo.idl\r\n\r\nThis comes from the ammo js library, an advanced physics engine written in C++ ported over to JavaScript. JavaScript developers stand in the unique position of mainly using high-level abstractions when interacting with code; they don't interact with pointers, or even need to worry about memory cleanup (for the most part), but they can also tap into the powerful processing power and speed of lower level languages such as C++ or precompiled binaries such as WASM using IDLs.

I'm happy to do the PR, if it is considered an acceptable idea!_\r\n\r\n# Testability\r\n\r\n## What is testability\r\n\r\nIn its simplest form, testability is how easy a system is to test. This hides a lot of complexity but is a great starting point for a conversation. A testable system is one that enables a wide variety of testing types. From unit tests to exploratory testing. Plus other testing activities for specific needs such performance, security and accessibility.\r\n\r\n## Why is it important\r\n\r\nTestability is a vital property of modern software. It enables software teams to make changes rapidly and safely. With clear feedback loops to understand the impact of changes. Developers need it to put in place change with confidence. Testers need it to assess risk and provide actionable information. With better testability product management can experiment with features for feedback.\r\n\r\n## How do you know if something is testable\r\n\r\n* You are in control of the amount of feedback your product gives you. Allowing either a deep, detailed view or a wide, shallow view. Rather than trying to parse what your product is doing, it will tell its story.\r\n* The product can be set into a state of your choosing, whether that be data or configuration. Allowing you to develop your product with much more certainty.\r\n* After release, you are not dreading the call from support that your customers are unhappy. Monitoring, alerting and metrics mean any problems are seen early and managed proactively.\r\n\r\nWatch - A Super Quick Guide to Testability by Nicola Lindgren <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPtlaOSuX88>\r\n\r\nRead - Untangling Testability by Rob Meaney <https://teatimewithtesters.com/untangling-testability/>\r\n\r\nRead - Testability and how to improve it by Alex Romanov <https://alexromanov.github.io/2022/08/14/what-is-testability/>\r\n\r\nWatch - Architecting for Testability by Emily Bache <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pybZziC7y2o>\r\n\r\nAct - 30 Days of Testability by Ash Winter and Rob Meaney <https://www.ministryoftesting.com/dojo/lessons/30-days-of-testability?s_id=13945699>"}, {'title': '[Suggestion] DevOps Roadmap', 'body': 'Learn some CI/CD Tool - Bamboo is obsolete\r\nCentOS - End-of-life Jun 30th, 2024'}, {'title': '[Suggestion] iOSDeveloper', 'body': 'Can u pls bring the roadmap for an iOS developer as well.'}, {'title': '[Suggestion] Go Developer', 'body': 'Hi,\r\nMaybe you should add a new topic near the Mutex that it\'s called "Atomic"'}, {'title': '[Suggestion] Backend Developer', 'body': 'Add MVC architectural pattern.'}, {'title': '[Suggestion] Backend Developer - Search Engines', 'body': 'Hi\r\n\r\nFor Search Engines, Opensearch is another alternative thats can be added as alternative to Elasticsearch.\r\n\r\nhttps://opensearch.org/'}, {'title': '[Suggestion] JavaScript Roadmap', 'body': "Please add only video in English, because many section have videos in different language, and it's quite confusing.\r\n\r\nThank you "}, {'title': '[Suggestion] GraphQL', 'body': 'These lines are drawn to the wrong sides, they should be flipped.

It currently lists 3 choices, which are GetX, VelocityX, and Redux. Professionally GetX is not looked very well upon. It frightens me that the 3 most widespread, well-documented, and best state management packages are NOT on the list. Of course I am biased as well, but VelocityX and Redux can never beat Provider, Riverpod Provider, nor BLoC. And although I don't want to debate this, GetX should, in my opinion, not even be on the list. You don't learn Flutter when using GetX, you learn GetX.\r\n\r\nProvider, if I remember correctly, is the package which is currently (officially) recommended by Flutter. Riverpod Provider is created by the same author.\r\n\r\nAnother shortcoming I noticed, was the lack of explaining eg.

When it comes to backend, they don’t need anything fancy, so they use Backend-as-a-Service offerings like Firebase or Supabase, and it does the job. When it comes to deployments, they use hosting providers like Netlify or Vercel.\r\n\r\n- **Self-sufficient backend developer.** They build apps mainly using modern backend tech like Go. When it comes to frontend, they don’t need a fancy UI, so they build simple front-end using Bootstrap, and it does the job.

Some are very rarely used in practice.\r\n* If props are seen as fundamental then I think custom events and slots are too. Arguably component `v-model` deserves a separate mention too.

In martial arts terms, it is designed to take a “white belt” in cybersecurity to becoming a “blue belt”, able to approach (simple) CTFs and wargames. The philosophy of pwn.college is “practice makes perfect”.\r\n\r\npwn.college was created by [Zardus (Yan Shoshitaishvili)](https://yancomm.net/) and [kanak (Connor Nelson)](https://connornelson.com/) at Arizona State University. It powers ASU’s Computer Systems Security course, CSE466, and is now open, for free, to participation for interested people around the world!\r\n\r\n## Getting Started\r\n\r\nAt the core of pwn.college is flags. How do you get those flags? Solve challenges. You can start a challenge by clicking on the Challenges tab at the top, selecting a module, clicking on a particular level, and hitting Start. In order to access that challenge, you have two options.\r\n\r\nThe first option is using the Workspace tab. This will present you with a fully functional development environment in your browser via Visual Studio Code. You can, for instance, quickly open a new terminal by pressing F1, searching for New Terminal, and pressing enter.\r\n\r\nThe second option is using ssh. In order to ssh into your challenge instances, you must add a public ssh key to Settings > SSH Key. You can quickly generate an ssh key by running ssh-keygen -f key -N '' in a terminal on your (unix-friendly) host machine. This will generate files key and key.pub, which are your private and public keys respectively. Once you have linked your ssh key to your account, you can run ssh -i key hacker@dojo.pwn.college to connect into your challenge instance.\r\n\r\nOnce you are in a challenge instance, your goal is to get the contents of the /flag file. Unfortunately for you, you are executing as the hacker user, but /flag is only readable by the root user. Fortunately, however, there are challenge programs located inside of the /challenge directory, which when run, will run with the privileges of the root user. Solve the challenge to get the /flag, and then submit it in order to complete the challenge!\r\n\r\nA few things to note. Your home directory /home/hacker is persistent. This means that when you start a new challenge, all of the files you have saved in there will still be there. The Practice button can be incredibly useful for debugging your solution. When you start a challenge in this way, you will have the ability to run programs as the root user with the sudo command; however, the instance will only have a practice flag. For some of the later (kernel-focused) challenges, you will need to solve the challenge in a virtual machine. You can interact with the virtual machine using the vm command.\r\n\r\n"}, {'title': '[Minor Typo] Computer Science roadmap Tries != Trees', 'body': 'Just a note, computer science roadmap says Tries instead of Trees.\r\n\r\n<img width="338" alt="image" src="https://github.com/kamranahmedse/developer-roadmap/assets/8909476/b469acba-a920-46e6-b79b-5299187b89eb">\r\n\r\n\r\nmiddle of page: https://roadmap.sh/computer-science'}, {'title': '[Suggestion] Cyber Security Expert', 'body': 'Certifications are incorrectly categorized.\r\n\r\n- CompTIA A+ and CompTIA Network+ help in getting started with networking but they are not security certifications.\r\n- CompTIA Security+, GSEC, GPEN are beginner level certifications.\r\n- GWAPT, CEH and OSCP are also considered beginner level but they are not easy.

Cache-Aside:\r\n\r\nIn cache-aside caching, the application is responsible for managing the cache directly. When data is requested, the application checks the cache first. If the data is found in the cache, it is returned. If not, the application retrieves the data from the underlying data source, adds it to the cache, and then returns it to the requester.\r\n\r\nImagine you have a bookshelf where you keep your favorite books. Whenever you want to read a book, you first check your bookshelf. If the book is already there, you pick it up and start reading. If it's not on the bookshelf, you go to the bookstore, buy the book, bring it home, and add it to your bookshelf before you start reading it.\r\n\r\n2. Write-Through:\r\n\r\nIn write-through caching, when data is updated or written to the cache, it is also immediately written to the underlying data store or database. This ensures that both the cache and the data store are always in sync.\r\n\r\nImagine you have a personal diary where you record your daily activities. Whenever you do something noteworthy, you write it down in your diary and also immediately tell your best friend about it. This way, your diary and your friend always have the same information.\r\n\r\n3. Write-Behind:\r\n\r\nIn write-behind caching, data updates are initially written to the cache without immediately updating the underlying data store. The updates are eventually propagated to the data store in the background or when certain conditions are met, such as a batch write or a specific time interval.\r\n\r\nSuppose you have a shopping list that you keep adding items to as you run out of them. Instead of going to the grocery store immediately after adding each item to the list, you wait until the end of the week and then go to the store with your complete list, making one big purchase.\r\n\r\n4. Refresh-Ahead:\r\n\r\nRefresh-ahead caching, also known as prefetching, involves proactively fetching data from the underlying data source and updating the cache before it is explicitly requested. This anticipates future access to the data and reduces the latency of retrieving it when it is actually needed.\r\n\r\nImagine you are hosting a party, and you know that your guests will likely ask for drinks throughout the evening. Instead of waiting for them to ask for each drink individually, you proactively prepare a tray of assorted drinks and keep it nearby, ready to serve.

By including promises in the roadmap, JavaScript developers can take advantage of a standardized approach to handling asynchronous tasks, leading to more robust and scalable applications. Additionally, integrating promises will pave the way for adopting modern JavaScript features and libraries, ensuring that the language remains relevant and adaptable to the ever-evolving web development landscape.\r\n\r\nTo get started with pro mises, developers can refer to the official Mozilla Developer Network (MDN) documentation on JavaScript promises, available at [.](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise) This comprehensive resource provides in-depth explanations, examples, and best practices, allowing developers to master the usage and implementation of promises in their JavaScript projects efficiently.\r\n\r\n"}, {'title': 'Exporting updated progress', 'body': "### Feature Description\n\nIt would be neat to be able to export the updated progress in a more easily shared/posted form for posting (I'm posting it publicly as a kind of motivation) like png/jpg/webp.

I believe that it would be beneficial to add a feature that allows users to download the entire roadmap, including all of its subpages. This would be a valuable tool for users who want to keep a copy of the roadmap for reference or who want to share it with others.\r\n\r\nI understand that you currently allow users to download individual roadmap pages. However, this can be time-consuming if a user wants to download the entire roadmap. Additionally, it is not possible to download all of the subpages of a roadmap page with the current functionality.\r\n\r\nI believe that adding a feature to download the entire roadmap would be a relatively simple change to make. It would also be a valuable addition to your website, as it would make it easier for users to access and share the roadmap.\r\n\r\nThank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to hearing from you soon.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nAthar Imran'}, {'title': 'Game Developer Roadmap', 'body': "### What is the title of the roadmap you are submitting?\n\nRoadmap to learn Game Development\n\n### Is this roadmap prepared by you or someone else?\n\nI prepared this roadmap\n\n### Roadmap Items\n\n# Game Developer Roadmap for 2023\r\n\r\n## Prerequisites:\r\n- Basic programming knowledge (C++, C#, or Python).\r\n  - [C++ Roadmap](https://roadmap.sh/cpp)\r\n  - [Python Roadmap](https://roadmap.sh/python)\r\n- Understanding of mathematics and physics.\r\n\r\n## Learning Game Engines:\r\n- Unity (C#) or Unreal Engine (C++).\r\n  - [Unity Learn](https://learn.unity.com/)\r\n  - [Unreal Online Learning](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/onlinelearning-courses)\r\n\r\n## Graphics and Animation:\r\n- Blender for 3D modeling.\r\n  - [Blender Guru](https://www.blenderguru.com/)\r\n- Photoshop for 2D art.\r\n  - [Adobe's Photoshop Tutorials](https://helpx.adobe.com/photoshop/tutorials.html)\r\n\r\n## Sound Design:\r\n- Audacity for audio editing.\r\n  - [Audacity Manual](https://manual.audacityteam.org/)\r\n\r\n## Game Development Optimization:\r\n- Learn optimization techniques for code and graphics.\r\n  - [Game Development Optimization](https://jarlowrey.com/blog/game-optimizations)\r\n\r\n## Multiplayer and Networking:\r\n- Unreal Engine offers courses on networking and multiplayer development.\r\n  - [Unreal Engine Networking and Multiplayer](https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.0/en-US/networking-and-multiplayer-in-unreal-engine/)\r\n\r\n## Version Control with Git:\r\n- [Git Tutorial](https://youtu.be/apGV9Kg7ics?si=frFYJ_Ia39N5jDOQ)\r\n\r\n## Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR) Development (Optional):\r\n- Explore VR/AR development.\r\n  - [Oculus Developer Hub](https://developer.oculus.com/)\r\n\r\n## Real-time Graphics (Optional):\r\n- Study real-time rendering techniques.\r\n  - [Real-Time Rendering, Fourth Edition (Book)]\r\n\r\n## Continuous Learning:\r\n- Stay updated on game development trends and technologies.\r\n  - [Gamasutra](https://www.gamedeveloper.com/)\r\n\r\n## Community Engagement:\r\n- Join game development forums and communities.\r\n  - [GameDev.net Forums](https://www.gamedev.net/)\r\n"}, {'title': 'Dead link', 'body': '### What is the URL where the issue is happening\n\nhttps://roadmap.sh/best-practices/frontend-performance\n\n### What browsers are you seeing the problem on?\n\nChrome\n\n### Describe the Bug\n\nIn Minified HTML - Remove comments and whitespaces\r\n![image](https://github.com/kamranahmedse/developer-roadmap/assets/37517008/253144c1-34be-42d9-88e3-f82de003b669)\r\n\r\n[HTML minifier | Minify Code](http://minifycode.com/html-minifier/)\r\n![image](https://github.com/kamranahmedse/developer-roadmap/assets/37517008/464382a0-a350-4c0a-b66c-00f517cad7b2)\r\n\r\nis a dead link, the website no longer available.\n\n### Output from browser console (if any)\n\n_No response_\n\n### Participation\n\n- [ ] I am willing to submit a pull request for this issue.'}], 'pageInfo': {'endCursor': 'Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpHOcJWI6A==', 'hasNextPage': True}}}}}{'data': {'repository': {'issues': {'nodes': [{'title': 'Add AI and DS roadmap to related roadmaps', 'body': '### Roadmap URL\n\nhttps://roadmap.sh/python\n\n### Suggestions\n\nPlease add [AI and Data Scientist Roadmap](https://roadmap.sh/ai-data-scientist) to the `Related Roadmaps` in the {Python Roadmap}(https://roadmap.sh/python)\r\n\r\n![roadmap sh_python](https://github.com/kamranahmedse/developer-roadmap/assets/79869936/1268f782-9517-45c5-8bab-b5badf394b8d)\r\n'}, {'title': 'New Javascript Package Manager Update In Frontend Development Roadmap', 'body': '### Roadmap URL\n\nhttps://roadmap.sh/frontend\n\n### Suggestions\n\n- New Package Manager Is Introduced  Recently Which Is Very Fast & Stable Called "[BUN](https://bun.sh/)".\r\n- Adding That With Resources Under Package Managers Might Be Helpful For New Learners.'}, {'title': 'Servers', 'body': '### Roadmap URL\n\nhttps://roadmap.sh/backend\n\n### Suggestions\n\nIt would be nice to have, a dedicated "Servers" lesson/node right after "Internet".\r\n\r\nExamples:\r\nWhat is a Server?

Here\'s an idea for incorporating a project introduction at the end of a roadmap:\r\n\r\nConcept: "The Grand Finale Project"\r\n\r\nRoadmap sections:\r\n1. Foundation Building: Start your roadmap by outlining the foundational steps and milestones that are necessary to prepare for the grand finale. This could include research, resource allocation, and team building.\r\n\r\n2. Progress and Milestones: As you move along the roadmap, showcase the incremental achievements and milestones reached. This section will create a sense of accomplishment and momentum.\r\n\r\n3. Challenges and Adaptations: Highlight any challenges or unexpected developments faced during the journey, along with the strategies used to overcome them. This adds a layer of transparency and learning.\r\n\r\n4. The Grand Finale Project Introduction: At this point, near the end of your roadmap, set the stage for your "Grand Finale Project." Here\'s how you can do it:\r\n\r\n    - Name and Teaser: Reveal the name of the project and provide a tantalizing teaser that sparks curiosity. For example, "Project X: The Ultimate Game-Changer. Get Ready for Something Big!"\r\n\r\n    - Objectives and Impact: Briefly describe the objectives of the project and the potential impact it can have. Explain how it aligns with the overarching goals and strategy.\r\n\r\n    - Key Features or Elements: Share a few key features, elements, or innovations that make this project special. This could be a new product, a game-changing process, or a transformative initiative.\r\n\r\n    - Timeline: Give a high-level estimate of when the project will kick off and its expected duration. This builds anticipation as stakeholders can look forward to a specific timeframe.\r\n\r\n    - Engagement Opportunities: Mention how various stakeholders can get involved or contribute to the success of the project. Whether it\'s through ideation sessions, cross-functional teams, or funding, make it clear how everyone can participate.\r\n\r\n5. Conclusion and Next Steps: Conclude the roadmap by summarizing the journey so far and transitioning into the "Grand Finale Project" phase. Outline the immediate next steps and encourage everyone to stay engaged and excited.\r\n\r\nBy introducing the grand finale project at the end of the roadmap, you create a sense of climax and leave your audience eager to see the roadmap\'s conclusion. This approach not only informs stakeholders about the project but also makes them feel like they\'ve been a part of an exciting journey, making them more invested in the final project\'s success.'}], 'pageInfo': {'endCursor': 'Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpHOdAYD-A==', 'hasNextPage': True}}}}}{'data': {'repository': {'issues': {'nodes': [{'title': 'Bring the Android Developer Roadmap ', 'body': '### Detailed Description\n\nThe current Android developer roadmap is good but currently it is as a single image and not very functionable It will be better we have it like other roadmaps which are live.\r\n\r\nI can make the roadmap from the image and add some required features extra and submit it.
