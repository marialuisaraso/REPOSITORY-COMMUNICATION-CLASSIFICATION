Added Resources for HTTP (#1088)* Adding an extra resource on HTTPI've recently read this 3-part series on HTTP, mostly focused on HTTP/3 and QUIC, but the first part covers basic concepts about HTTP and how it evolved to HTTP/3 (which is really HTTP/2-over-QUIC) and I find it might be a great reading resource on the topic.I'm not recommending the 2nd and 3rd parts as they're linked through the 1st one and they diverge a little from the topic of HTTP (going into performance improvements and deployment of QUIC)* Replicating new HTTP resource to back end roadmap

Like seriously i cant see elixir ?
When I saw this roadmap I thought. Why I should chose this technologies or the other one? Perhaps if each box was clickable to show some informations about each technology this informations will help others to decide which to chose.
I think those deserve a mention as well. Congrats on the great guide!
To beginners, I found I can not learn everything in the roadmaps. I just need to learn the appropriate ones. So can the roadmaps add some character about the some terms. For example, I just need to use Gradle or Maven in the Spring Project. If I know that Gradle is the better choice (just what i think), I don't need to focus on Maven. 
You should add on Python > Framework > asynchronous > sanic https://github.com/channelcat/sanic
[Here it is](https://my.mindnode.com/zRGj6Bjd1T31sVhsJz4HcNbCCz7ZMgKNqJSWSjyt#375.4,-197.2,2). It's part of a [bigger interactive mind map](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/knowledge-map) I am making.I think it is a lot better than just having static images as I embed links for all nodes and users can pan around and see everything. I would love it if you can add a link of it to the repository. I think it would be really useful.I will also complete one for 'backend' in similar manner and add it. :)Thank you.
This is super helpful, thanks for putting it together. Given the name of this project as `developer-roadmap`, I assume a developer can be a mobile app developer.
It would be useful if added a roadmap for html5 game development field.
In the DevOps part, just after "Start Building", "**Knowlege about**" should be "**Knowledge about**".
https://newrelic.com/
Hi, i'm wondering if it's possible to add DynamoDB to the NoSQL databases.Or let me know if not apply.Thanks,Greetings !

On the back end diagram, the Python box has a line leading from it to "Frameworks" and then a line to "Sync".  Right below it, there is a line that goes from Python to "Async". Shouldn't the line to "Async" come from "Frameworks"?
Add SEO roadmap. Example:- Semrush,- Alexa, - Google Analytics, Trends, Webmaster tools- Structured data, - AB Testingmore...

In the frontend roadmap, JSX should be added, with an arrow from React, as to learn react you need JSX.
Babel, "_the_ compiler for writing next-gen JS", isn't there! It's an important tool that you need to know. It should be under the "Going deeper > Javascript > ES6" section.
AJAX needs to be added to front end development. Not much to add here :P

Hi. I think you should also add mobile app development like Android, iOS and others too in the front-end development. It is also a user-facing development as well. I do not understand why that is ignored.
Should not elasticsearch be added to NoSQL databases..?and also what about the other ELK stack tools like Kibana and Logstash.. they might feature in a web developer profile..?
Hi there,perhaps you should re-consider recommending unittest? unittest is pretty ugly Java-esque code, with all its `self.assertEqual` `self.assertTrue` and so on. In pytest, you can just do `assert foo == bar` and there is no forced OOP (the Java part).
Remove the "Start Building" icon.It is not the case that you learn these technologies and then start building.  In reality, you start building and then research and learn these technologies more as you go along.

[pnpm](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm) is also a decent package manager over npm. You should consider adding it.
Hey @kamranahmedse,I made a UI/UX roadmap. A lot of people have asked for it:https://github.com/togiberlin/ui-ux-designer-roadmapIf you like it, maybe you could reference it in your developer roadmap readme file 😄 Thanks again for the awesome developer roadmap! Keep it going akhiBest,Togi
A large, important sub-path is entirely missing from the current frontend roadmap. I would call this a "sub-path" because it is entirely possible to be a successful, competent frontend developer without it, but for many frontend developers this path represents a serious chunk of their workload, and represents a very in-demand option for frontend development – especially for developers who are have a visual aptitude.*Rough outline of a "Visual Programming" path*- Visual Programming  * Animation    + GSAP (recommendation)    + MoJs    + Bodymovin  * WebGL    + Shaders (recommendation)  * 2D    + `<canvas>` (recommendation)    + Pixi.js (recommendation)  * 3D    + Three.js (recommendation)These are the tools I've found most important in my growth as a visual programmer, but I'm probably leaving something out. What am I missing?
For newbies (like myself), I think it would be a great if this road map could outline what devOps is and the differences between front- and backend development are. :) 

Instead of "Knowlege about different file systems?" it should be "Knowledge about different file systems" (adding a "d" to "Knowledge", and preferably without the "?")
Loopback is a good Node.js framework with some ready to use Enterprise level solutions. I think it will be a good idea to add loopback in the Node.js framewrok section in the **Back-end**.Loopback [Website](https://loopback.io/)
Would adding agile SCRUM or Kanban be important? I think so, but just asking.
Such as [Hadoop](http://hadoop.apache.org/), [Spark](http://spark.apache.org/) become more important while the data become more large.
In my opinion front end roadmap is good but most of the focus goes of to JavaScript and I think you should spread focus between JavaScript and CSS( SCSS ) as you can't be good front end dev if you are not strong with CSS. Hope this helps to improve roadmap :)
"Socket.IO enables real-time bidirectional event-based communication. It works on every platform, browser or device, focusing equally on reliability and speed." as they describe themselves on their website (https://socket.io). It is a powerful and popular technology that comes immensely handy in real-time analytics, binary streaming, real-time communication and document collaboration among many others.
I work with OpenStack and would love to see it represented here. Thanks!

Can this todo item be resolved with those resources [front-end](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome#front-end-development), [back-end](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome#back-end-development) and [devops](https://github.com/AcalephStorage/awesome-devops)?P.S. This [awesome list](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome) has a lot of resources for the DevOps but not in one section.
Title is self explanatory, link below for reference.https://pypi.python.org/pypi/tox
message broker are important for distributed system to do an asynchronous comunication between services, it's widely used and quite important.[Rabbit MQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com/) and [Apache Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/) are quite popular message brokers.
As a part of web development, i think webgis development branch should be added. [OpenLayers](http://openlayers.org/), [Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com/), [GoogleMaps JS](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/) for JS mapping library. [Geoserver](http://geoserver.org/), [Map Server](http://mapserver.org/), [Mapnik](http://mapnik.org/) for spatial data server.

The front end probably needs the addition of Ionic etc, plus mobile (java, c++, swift) is perhaps a whole 'nuther ecosystem
CI service [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/)Of course if you put in jenkins it will not be a comparison, even if I look at the following trends, I feel that circleci can be inserted.https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?q=circleci,travisci,teamcity#161
Both Laravel and Symfony are based on Symfony components. In opposite Zend (ZF3 and Expressive) is one of the most popular frameworks which components are widely used as stand-alone packages.
Love the RoadMap, thank you for making it. Don't shoot me for asking—but where does WordPress fall into the RoadMap?
Love this visual. I would love to see a mention of css-in-jss in there somewhere. 
I love this project! I'm junior front end developer, and have done a few internships now. I printed the front end diagram off and took it into a progress meeting earlier to discuss things that I need to get better on, as a bigger picture of what a Front End developer is. We used it as a tool for evaluation and future learning planning.It'd be super cool if you could interact with the images - like if there was a colour code and you could mark off things you can do in varying shades of green or something, where white is no knowledge and dark green is confident and shades in between. I'm going to do something similar to the above on paper for now. I might also work on a PR for this as a learning activity at some point :) it might be useful for others too - I came across this project from it being shared in the [codebar](/codebar.io) slack group, where lots of people are all also learning and in the process of becoming developers too :)
While it doesn't get the same love as other frameworks, it's still viable as a good option for full-stack JS apps.https://www.meteor.com/
Environment Management tools are pretty essential for python development.Some of them:* Pipenv * pyenv* venv* virtualenv* virtualenvwrapper
They are essential part of any development, Some of them:* pdb* ipdb* remote-pdb* wdb* line_profiler * memory_profiler* django-debug-toolbar
1. Separate Angular and Angular JS2. Add ngrx/store (redux like solution inspired by rxjs) to Angular
Since Symfony 4 was released (and now is a micro-framework just like Silex) "Silex ends as a project in June 2018". Removing it now would be better than later because Silex users need to migrate to Symfony 4 anyway. Read more here: https://github.com/symfony/symfony-docs/issues/8678

Happy new year! :1st_place_medal: Let's update the content to year 2018.
Bulma (https://bulma.io/) has been picking up a lot of steam over the last year or two... pretty sure it should be added  
Linting and the process of checking code before it is compiled and ran is an important part of developing. I would suggest adding ESLint under a 'Linters' section on the Roadmap. Some great configurations under ESLint are [Airbnb's config](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-config-airbnb) and [Prettier's config](https://github.com/prettier/eslint-config-prettier).
I want to know the tool/method you use to draw the roadmap, it looks gorgeous to mePlease let me know
ArangoDB (ArangoDB is an easy to use mostly memory, high performance, open source NoSQL database with a unique combination of features like graph & geo algorithms.) should go under nosql databasesMosquitto (Eclipse Mosquitto is an open source message broker that implements the MQTT protocol versions 3.1 and 3.1.1.) should go under message brokers.
Visual Studio Team Services is an also good option, when working with Microsoft products. You can add it in white color, because other competitors like Jenkins and TeamCity has more configuration option. 
Package manager - NugetTesting - NUnit (yellow)- Specflow (grey)- XUnit (grey)- FluentAssertions- Moq (yellow with seperate arrow)Framework- ASP.Net MVC 5 (yellow)- WCF (Yellow)- Entity Debugger/Profiler- ReSharperDependency Injection- Unity (yellow)- MEF- Ninject
Would be great to have search to some degree. Say I hear a technology while talking with some colleagues, but not sure where it falls in the roadmap. Being able to ctrl-f would be quite valuable. 
It will be only fair to add FuseBox, we’ve been around for 1 year already fuse-box.org
i readed "I have been experimenting lately with Go and I quite like it." but don't see go in backend roadmap
It would be good if you add separate batches for android and iOS development. Also having game as sub branches in android and iOS would make sense too. Cheers 
Front dev webgl path is missing.
Currently the state management libraries/patterns look to be exclusive to React. This is not correct as these libraries are frontend framework agnostic and can be used with almost all front end libraries.  How about having a separate "state management" section for these entities?
I think if any game developers see this they could add their key topics to it.
Enzyme should be linked to React not to Javascript testing section. According to the Enzyme's [README](https://github.com/airbnb/enzyme/#enzyme): "Enzyme is a JavaScript Testing utility for React that makes it easier to assert, manipulate, and traverse your React Components' output."
Grunt, Flux, Parcel, RequireJS/AMD, Browserify have a white background color. Should be painted with Possibilities background.Right? :sweat_smile:
We have Design Patterns at the 'Required for any path' section.But at Javascript (the bottom one) we have Design Patterns and GOF Design Patterns as well.Can we remove this duplication?
Regular Expressions (Regex) are search patterns used by string searching algorithms, so they are useful in the entire web stack not in a specific programming language.
We have two different CSS sections (top and bottom). Can we link the CSS bottom children (Methodologies and Dive Deep CSS3) directly to the top CSS, so we can have only one CSS section?
I think is the best PHP Framework for RAD. Lots of features / great doc / Fast.
I've seen it used increasingly as a replacement for gulp/grunt in addition to use as a bundler.
More specifically it should replace the XHProf (which is broken in PHP7) IMO. 
How about Kotlin? In my opinion is a promising language. Good choice in 2018 for backend. https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/server-overview.html
As a minor priority in PHP -> Frameworks path. I know that Fuel isn't integrated with PHP7, **but it claims itself as a PHP 5.3+ Framework**.It have some integrated packages like the [ORM](https://fuelphp.com/docs/packages/orm/intro.html), [AUTH](https://fuelphp.com/docs/packages/auth/intro.html) and [OIL](https://fuelphp.com/docs/packages/oil/intro.html).  
I love Semantic-UI, but it's really poorly maintained. When I first started coding it was my go-to, but then I realized update intervals are lengthy. Uikit3 on the other hand, is regularly updated and I believe is very fun to work with. I propose adding UIKit to the list.
On devops operating systems, windows should be included. We have references on applications/tools running on MS OS, so I believe this should be there.
On devops->loveForTerminal, will be a good addition to add **tmux** and **screen** as these two tools are widely used and are kinda important.ty
Hi, I really love this repo, but what is missing is a good security roadmap for newbies - maybe based on this source https://github.com/jesusprubio/strong-node ?
There are some techniques to achieve the good performance, some are listed in this posthttps://css-tricks.com/case-study-boosting-front-end-performance/

I think know how to good at use these tools is as important as the knowledge and should be regard as a resource1. Editor || IDE- Vim- Emacs- Sublime- Atom- VSCode- WebStorm- etc...2. Debug Tool- Google Chrome Develooper Tool- etc...3.  Terminal || Shell- iTerm- bash- zsh- oh-my-zsh- etc...
Sorry if this is a repeated topic, I coudn't find the previous one if such exists =].Maybe adding a reading list on all the possible technologies with good (mind opening) effect on the readers (proven reading list) by people and reference for the newcommers =].As a start, my recommendation for OOP and Design Patterns with the PHP technology - PHP, Object, Patterns and Practices.Hope you like the idea,Kr,Dany
canvas should be added as a front-end drawing toolhttps://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API
看得我眼淚直流了
This ticket is to start the discussion on the merit of including [CSS WG specifications and drafts](https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/current-work), and as an extension it's partial implementation through [cssnext](http://cssnext.io/features/) (which depends on [PostCSS](http://cssnext.io/setup/)).I'm sure there are plenty of ways to nitpick this, but in the past Javascript has seen languages and frameworks try to fill holes in functionality (e.g. CoffeeScript, jQuery), followed by movement in ECMA specifications and drafts, followed by transpilers (i.e. Babel), and then of course significant adoption.We are seeing the same thing with CSS; currently we have an ecosystem of CSS extensions and pre-processors (e.g. SASS, LESS), followed by movement in the CSS WG specifications and drafts, followed by (what is effectively) transpilers (i.e. cssnext). Given that the functionality either is/has a good chance of becoming the bona fide specification, we are seeing adoption.Of course, SASS and LESS are more feature rich, stable, and have significantly more adoption. However, if we are trying to prepare 2018-and-beyond front-end developers, I think cssnext and postcss are essential parts of their education.
I think it will be a good idea to add Java stack (Spring framework, hibernate, junit etc.) to the backend developer guide.

Why don't you add https://github.com/firehol/netdata in Monitoring and Alerting? 

Many companies are also hiring full-stack developers who should have knowledge in both frontend and backend.If we can add that into this roadmap, then it will help others to understand how to become a full-stack developer.

What about adding "concept" like SPA or progressive web app ?

Does the blue-dot-branching thing mean **several different modular parts** that you need, or does it mean **several alternatives**, or it can mean both? Is the following branching (attached screenshot) advising people to learn multiple backend platforms that basically serve the same purposes?![screen shot 2018-01-27 at 1 11 26 am](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10406532/35469250-6deea620-02ff-11e8-9de0-0a56215bcdd9.png)
Codeigniter claims itself as a PHP 5.3+ Framework.
SOLID/YAGNI/KISS should be required learning for all paths. While some of the solid principals are less applicable to front end developer, they still make front end developer better at their job. Especially if they are using typescript/flow.

In the front-end map, on the bottom-right, in yellow. I'm quite confused. The capitalization suggests that it's a technical term or title, and the words "dive deep" are usually encountered as "deep dive." I suspect that it means "Learn the advanced stuff offered by CSS3, such as..." referring to the items below. Just a label for a list. If that's the case, I recommend using a different visual. In every other list on the map, a grouping of boxes indicates "probably use only one of these per project; each one addresses the same general problem." But here, one is free to use all of these CSS3 properties and features in the same project.I propose renaming that box to "Advanced CSS3" and taking the label out of the box and onto the blue arrow, just like the "Methodologies" label above it. 
Feel free to take it ;)
You have used Redis is both Caching and NoSQL.Instead of redundancy, I would prefer to have Redis in NoSQL section.

Relevant services: graph.cool, graphcms, aws appsync
can some please help
In the DevOps section. All variety of things are mentioned. What about AI, Machine Learning, and Programming Languages.
I think jQuery is cool and very useful and a lot of font-end develeoper used it, So you can create a new category in Front-End -> Javascript -> Library and put jQuery there.Thanks.
I think you might consider expanding a little on some aspects of HTML. Mainly -- importance of semantics, accessibility, and progressive enhancement should be stressed out. 
It is not the most widely used tool in the industry according to my knowledge so it may beirrevelant for the roadmap.But I think learning to use a software like Jlint, JShint or Google Clojure Linteris a good thing to do for a web developper.
Minitest is a relevant tool for testing in Ruby. It is default in Ruby in Rails.

Hey there! Good job you are doing! Much appreciated!I didn't see Firebase in the chart. Please, consider adding it. That is some great tool for serverless development.
Would be nice to add cakephp to the list. There are many reasons like: slow release rate, good support, design paradigms like convention over configuration, etc. 

gitlab-ci in power of gitlab-runner is similar to jenkins etc.
Add Android / ios developmentAdd Hybrid mobile development
In roadmap yellow color highlight indicates things to be done first ? It should be made clear.
Manual and Automation QA would be quite useful.
Don't we have to learn Jquery for front end web development. Add it on front-end map.
Grata Tool that leverages Full development using  Java (nota javascript) from server, desktop and Cross native mobile for Android and IOS
Beginning of Backend section you write "personally I would prefer Node.js and PHP 7 for **the full time**. "Was this supposed to say for the **first** time or was it something else?  It's unclear to me what is meant as written.
I highly recommend adding Nest.js to Backend -> Node.js -> Framework list.https://nestjs.com/
Hi，I really appreciate  Roadmap to becoming a web developer in 2018,  But there's only a route out it，I wonder if you can give us some good study websites or documents about the route contents，THANKS
add celery to backend->python
IDE/Editor is not the most important part becoming a web developer but it is a tool that can change your focus on development.  You can specify IDE's especially for back-end development :  IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse  for Java IntelliJ Webstorm,Sublime for nodejs etc. 

Since the community is growing and this framework seems to become more and more popular I think it would be nice to add it.[Link for the website](http://hanamirb.org/)

In DevOps roadmap for 'Monitoring and Alerting' Zabbix should be yellow and Nagios gray.
I think the picture are so beautiful, what's the tool you used to draw this picture. thx~
The product/platform that the company Mesosphere develops is called DC/OS: https://dcos.ioAlso in my humble opinion Kubernetes should be yellow in the orchestrator section.Cheers for putting this together! Pretty cool to visualize the ecosystem.

On front-end roadmap, the list for server side rendering tools shows angular twice: the one connected to nuxt.js should be vue.js 
It says access denied whenever I pull.UPDATE:An Error appears now: ```Pull request creation failed. Validation failed: A pull request already exists for...```
Hi Kamran, great work, thank you.I think the front-end part lacks accessibility / WAI / WCAG / ARIA…, perhaps even on the legal (i.e. anti-discrimination laws) side.
As a .NET dev I noticed a whole lot of stuff missing in that branch. Seeing as .NET is a major player in enterprise web development and has a ton of interesting tech to offer.As an example of the missing stuff, here are some things that are there for different languages (PHP) but skipped in C#:- Laravel -> .NET/ASP.NET MVC/ASP.NET WebApi/ASP.NET WebForms/ASP.NET Core/Service Fabric- Composer -> NuGet- PHPUnit -> nUnit/xUnit- Mockery -> Moq- Blackfire -> Visual Studio Team Services- XHProf -> Application Insights/Visual Studio Diagnostics
I noticed at the end of frontend roadmap, it mentions an "ideas" directory. But i cannot seem to find it. Or is it in terms of opening an Issue to introduce an idea? 

Hello sir, I'm a graphic designer and I would love to contribute to your project with a logo. This is completely free, take it as a contribution. In case you agree I would be presenting sketches and you will be choosing/modifying the aspects you like more so we could work on the perfect logo for your project together.Let me know what do you think? best regards :)

The older tree style (DevOp section) is much easier to read since it only has title and no detail. My suggestion was to have two version of each, one with detail and one with only title which make it easier to skim through.
I was just wondering if there is anyone out there who thinks that maybe spreading the reach to blockchain, machine learning, networking, etc. might be beneficial?
Please can you add Ember back as JS framework? It is still one of the best frameworks and is actively used by high-profile companies, and it has a passionate community - albeit a smaller one than those for the three you have listed.
I prefer the last front end and back end roadmaps.
Elm should be mentioned as part of the front end development options. 


I think you should add tensorflow.js to this roadmap, it could be really beneficial to learn tensorflow.js in 2018.
Hi @kamranahmedse ,Thank you for creating a roadmap for Web developer. It's really useful for all.Are you interested to create similar road map for SDE position.
I'd suggest to re-create this into https://www.draw.io/ to have it open source and modifiable by the community over time.
Link for Summary (Tools for Testing) in FrontEnd Section (16'th block) is not working. 404 Error.
The "Now build something" and the blue dot at the legend, have no usage in the new "tree"... Remove them or change the image 😁![68747470733a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f4f5a554f5574492e706e67 copia](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7188313/40123564-cab0bf88-5926-11e8-87bd-7e97af4c35f3.png)
I cannot find any reference to single page application. please advise when to study this item
was thinking also you could add link or online places where someone can learning coding
On the top, there should be a bucket containing **programming fundamentals**. A person can learn some frameworks and languages, but jumping straight into those without the principles of programming is not sustainable and leads to a lot of confusion afterwards.
Hi,I think a reference about template engines should be made. It is a category which exists. Maybe not so important but templates exist and are used.
Oracle Cloud should be included in the "Cloud Providers" list of DevOps roadmap.

I hope you don't mind, I have [forked](https://github.com/alhoqbani/developer-roadmap) your repo and made an Arabic translation of the roadmaps. I also published an [article](https://3alam.pro/alhoqbani/articles/developer-roadmap) regarding the subject. And of course I credited your work and kept all references to your repo.Thank for the great guide. 
i'd appreciate if there's a road map for full stack
what does the background colour of boxes means?
Hey there,First of all I just wanted to say that this is a great resource that I've used countless times myself and have encouraged others to look at it when they're in a rut with their learning. I'm currently writing a blog post on the topic of how our industry is changing and to show a comparison I thought it'd be cool to show the differences a year has made to your roadmap.It got me thinking that it'd be really nice for archivability to create a tag/release for the different year versions. Thoughts?
While not popular (I.e. trendy), it exists in a lot environments and tools and it is useful to at least learn the basics. 

I'm a bit confused why DevOps is listed as a path, but in reality DevOps needs to be practiced by software engineers, operations, QA and what else. The formal definition of DevOps is not a profession. If you somehow learn all in this graph, and you have no clue about DevOps practices then you aren't doing DevOps at all.Right now the career path looks like a mix of operations, SRE and developer, but only tools and nothing else. And some of these tools should be in 'developer' category as well: cli tools, app monitoring, configuration management, debugging containers etc.This is a misrepresentation of what DevOps actually is imo.
Fetch API should be added instead of XMLHttpRequest(XHR) API as fetch uses promises which enables a simpler and cleaner API.
Greetings,For us dark theme users who appreciate transparency in images could you please update the rest of the images to be transparrent aswell.The following already have transparrent backgrounds:* https://github.com/kamranahmedse/developer-roadmap/blob/master/images/backend.png* https://github.com/kamranahmedse/developer-roadmap/blob/master/images/devops.png* https://github.com/kamranahmedse/developer-roadmap/blob/master/images/split.pngThe following need updating to be transparrent background. I could do this myself but if you have the source project files for those images then it would save me trying to use magic wand tool on it and getting inaccurate clipping of images:* https://github.com/kamranahmedse/developer-roadmap/blob/master/images/disclaimer.png* https://github.com/kamranahmedse/developer-roadmap/blob/master/images/frontend-v2.pngExample of how I detected this issue:![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15659301/43194363-13fd3c20-8ffa-11e8-8b13-34672d62c227.png)Notice how the latter image fits in well with my dark CSS theme since it has a transparrent background. 
Greetings, What do you guys think of adding ALM path?

Thanks for the roadmap, it's super useful. I would be asking if we planning to add roadmap for chatbot developer
Thanks for the roadmap, it's super useful. I would be asking if we planning to add roadmap for blockchain developer
As I could see many frameworks you have listed in the roadmap;  ![node-2018](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17572818/43857611-730797cc-9b69-11e8-87f1-086eb6cabd08.png)It would be nice; if you add it. Thanks!
I'm sorry if this issue has been raised before; I tried searching but couldn't find it. I'm just wondering why the numbering is so? Any special reason for using number 17 & 18 twice in the diagram? ![frontendnumbering_duplicate](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28777569/44083155-c5c9664a-9fe5-11e8-998b-c93408a493eb.png)
Ecelente work most lacked by Neo4J, the most used Graph Bank in the world!:-)
I just wanna try how to type some words.Forget it!
and something about HPC  roadmap, SaaS, PaaS, IaaS platform model etc.
**Overall it is good roadmap, awesome infographic!**I have some thoughts about it.When I interview of candidate I would like to know different sides of his professional knowledge, I wanna say it wouldn't be enough to know some tools or languages. The roadmap focuses on languages, tools, libraries, frameworks but it is also good to know solution design, patterns, best practices, clean code, methodologies, etc.What do you think, should it be part of roadmap?
Great Job with the road map. I especially liked being able to see where I am currently on the map and where there are some holes behind that need to be filled.I would like to request to consider adding **Ember.js** as one of the Frontend frameworks listed as it is used by Netflix and LinkedIn as well as possessing a great developer community.
As you see it, any substantial changes in the near future?
Maybe for front-enders, we always choose some ui-components frameworks, such as:* element-ui* ant-design* semantic-uiLearning to build common ui-components by ourselves is an important skill in my sight 😄 .
Dear Kamran,I am looking C++ Transfer file send and receive code source need your help. ThanksRegards,Ali

I found PowerShell strangely lumped in with some shell editors (vi, emacs) on the DevOps roadmap. As it's not an editor, it would be great if you moved it next to Python, JavaScript, etc.
Balsamiq comes with a free 30-day trial when draw.io has a better functionality and completely free. 
Can you please add a french version or can i have the source so i can edit it and poste it here .I am a professor in France 
Nodejs is not a language. It might be misleading.
Add in some path, maybe in backend, (a kinda distinct path) for functional programming, maybe something saying why use it too.
HiI think  graphql is a nice technic can have a place in roadmap with possibility of learning grade.
Even though you could argue that languages Python and JS and to a lesser extend C# covers serverless I think you should add it as it becomes more and more real at the backend - think Firebase and its ilk.In the same vein consider 'low code' platforms like ServiceNow and SalesForce.Finally intelligent backends powered by machine learning and other AI is very fast becoming a thing to consider

Why C# and Java as other option and not Enterprise Development ?Java and C# development not like usual development and more use in huge company and entrprise applications!
Typo in DevOps Roadmap - Puppe should be Puppet
On step #2, it reads “Excercise and make some” and should be “Exercise and make some”
Change 2018 to 2019 where it is applicable.
Especially since this is a beginner's guide, it's important to use as accurate of language as possible.  One common mistake: [There is no such thing as CSS3](https://rachelandrew.co.uk/archives/2016/09/13/why-there-is-no-css4-explaining-css-levels/).

Details reads "... there is more push push towards..." with _push_ repeating as it wraps to a new line.
React Native [Personal Recommendation!]NativeScript [Available Options]Flutter [Available Options]
There's copy in the last **Basics Of JavaScript** box that reads:> Understand the concepts of _Hosting_It should be hoisting.
You can give many recomendations about ORM's for the languages. Should we learn about ORM's, and what topics about these? 
None of you in 19 contributors thought of socket.io
When I downloaded the "backend.png" to my iPhone, the color black of the word "Back-end" and "Keep exploring" matched the color black of the background, which made it hard to read. https://github.com/kamranahmedse/developer-roadmap/blob/master/images/backend.png
[Stylus.js](https://github.com/stylus/stylus/) is JS only, no RubyGem required as SASS does, it can also be interchanged with SASS for some things (but not really the other way around). If you're including PostCSS, you should also include Stylus.HTML pre-processors are also great tools. [HAML](http://haml.info/) and [Pug](https://github.com/pugjs/pug) (formerly Jade) are both good for semantic markup and tag completion, although Pug has a simpler markup system.
As a developer, i'm really missing Graphql clients for front-end path like Apollo-client or Relay-modern
There is no legend indicating what grey identifies and it appears to be the only grey box.
Ionic is widely used in the frontend world for mobile (and cross-platform) and should be on the mobile roadmap list. Happy to help make it happen
I really love these charts and find them a great steer of things to learn about. It would be nice to see Accessibility a yellow, personal recommendation box for a frontend developer. I’m not sure that knowing about accessibility should be implied as an “optional” extra and more of a requirement of most frontend web development.
Please add Zurb Foundation. 
hi，Several of you this picture I saw when I was 17 years, you just change the time to 19 years, want to ask next to the original source?

There are lots of other activities that can be done via computers: - Animation- Game Development- Security- IT- SEO- etc.@kamranahmedse , will you accept other activities in this repo as well?

GitHub please let me unsubscribe from this, I have tried so many times but still end up getting mails.. please for god sake forgive me and unsubscribe from this thread alone..._Originally posted by @waheedsid in https://github.com/kamranahmedse/developer-roadmap/issues/542#issuecomment-453910874_
[Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) with [alertmanager](https://prometheus.io/docs/alerting/alertmanager/) and all different [exporters](https://prometheus.io/docs/instrumenting/exporters/) is widely used monitoring.Also [Grafana](https://grafana.com/) which is often used together with Prometheus but supports many different [data sources](https://grafana.com/plugins?type=datasource) has a lot of users from devops community.
The image of Back-end Roadmap has no background, so set it as white.
Hugo is a good choice, I hoped it would be there
Even though it is SSR it can do static exports too.
Hi, first of all, thanks for your project, I appreciate what you are doing. I have only one request, if it doesn't bother you, could you add some reference links based on your Personal recomendation
Under the Branch: **Basics of Javascript** - Understand the concepts **Hoisting** not **Hosting**
# why not includes the GraphQL?> I think it will be the trending of new API development, just like GitHub version 4.https://github.com/topics/github-apihttps://developer.github.com/
Teamcit should be Teamcity in the devops roadmap,same as Puppe should be Puppet
It can be quite difficult to think of application ideas to create and practise with.I.e. On the backend roadmap it mentions learning a message broker - what kind of simple project could people make to learn a message broker?
# Q: Hi @kamranahmedse, > I just want to know how to draw this roadmap and which tool be used?https://github.com/kamranahmedse/developer-roadmap/blob/master/images/frontend.pngA: > ...
I know front and back end are often used, but these terms are somewhat squishy.Back-end: serverFront-end can be:* web client/browser* mobile client (hybrid? native? cross-platform?)* stand-alone desktop application (I guess that's a front end as well?)* IoT and embedded? (not sure if it fits front end or not, it does fit client very often)* AR/VR? (not sure if it fits front end or not, it usually does fit client)Meaning, mainly the 'front end' is much broader than 'html/css' these days? 
What about adding resources for all the topics in the paths?
I really love your work here but I think you missed GitLab in the CI/CD section (Learn infrastructure as code)I am not saying this to promote it but I would suggest give this a try and then see.Currently, GitLab can help you remove many learning stages from your current diagram and as it says removing the complexity of multiple toolchains.In my opinion, developers should not be spending time in integrating tools instead there core focus should be on development.

# QuestionWould it make sense to pick a higher contrast, better Recommended / Possibilities / Meh color scheme?As an experienced web dev, it wasn't immediate obvious which items were being recommended vs being an possibilities. Both the Yellow and Orange have a heavy / deep color. Even with a key, there is mental overhead parsing the meaning.# My recommendation:Recommend = GreenPossibilities = GreyMeh = Very Soft RedThis will make the recommended route be more apparent. As green traditionally means 'good', 'grey' neutral, and 'red' bad. Think of a stoplight. Other colors could also be chosen that are more accessible.# Rough Demo![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/220755/55660454-420a8f80-57bb-11e9-8fef-296fcae69ac2.png)

Front-end developers now need to follow mobile-first workflow so I guess this should be highlighted in CSS knowledge
With the rise of distributed microservices, popular service mesh options should be included (perhaps in Devops step 6 container orchestration) i.e Istio,linkerd, envoy, etc

A useful addition to devops might be 'startup management' and 'service management'. Knowing a little about `initd` and/or `systemd` can be extremely useful in understanding startup problems. Knowing how `systemd` units work is critical too, especially when managing daemons, docker, etc.
Some web design concepts, such as Responsive Design, Design System, are useful for helping building large web project. Any thoughts?
On [Roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh/) the image [simple_heart.svg](https://roadmap.sh/assets/img/simple_heart.svg) shifts slightly when hovering over the sponsor's images.
Semantic UI should be removed from the roadmap as this package seems to be drying off...I used to use it in some projects, but just lately looked at updating it...instead I will be replacing it with some other option:https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI/graphs/code-frequencyhttps://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI/pulse/monthlyI'm experienced with Bootstrap for 5 years. Lately, I've used AntDesign and Bulma. AntDesign is lacking in English docs but is advancing fast. Bulma doesn't support IE11 which could be a major issue for your client!Tachyons is looking solid: https://github.com/tachyons-css/tachyons
HiAzure DevOps is a great multi tool, where one part is CI/CD. It's free to use with open source project on GitHub.  
"...ScopePrototype..."should read"...Scope,Prototype..."
Babel, "the compiler for writing next-gen JS", isn't there! It's an important tool that you need to know. It should be under the "Front-end->Build Tools->Transpiler->Babel" section.

as far as i know, some other state management for angular are good to learn tho. they based on **ngrx** they are:- **NGXS**- **Akita**Akita is not only for angular but it can also use in **react** & **vue**.or, in other hand, maybe you should add new section for learning state management since it quite difficult to learn (IMHO).
It can be useful to add resources, books, videocourses to every topic
Hello, I am very grateful for this initiative, but to improve and facilitate the study of who starts now in this area I find it important to have a content or link for documentation on each of the topics in the raod map.Obrigado :)

I'm currently trying to develop a personal roadmap for a trainee. So I came to the issue when the roadmap suggests us to make a blog with registration etc. The problem is that at this point we don't have expirience in UI at all. All we know is CLI. I suggest adding some brief frontend requirements to the [Introduction](https://github.com/kamranahmedse/developer-roadmap#introduction) section. Any thoughts?
can you please add Roadmaps to learn Ethical Hacking and some more other fields
Failing to mention that choosing any other language than JavaScript kills their easy route to full stack development is problematic. Also, Nodejs is not a language.
The term is as much meaningful as "Java/JavaScript" or "Ham/Hamster" or "D/Delphi". Each of these is a different language and has different conventions.There is some bias that C and C++ are somehow related and should be written as one term. They have as much in common as JavaScript and Java: just a part of the name, because one language was partially based on another.Adding more from Stroustrup's FAQ:> [...] people use "C/C++" as if it meant something specific and as if they knew what it meant, leading to much confusion and misery. People should ask "What is C/C++?" and then on reflection stop using the term. It does harm.>> There is no language called "C/C++". The phrase is usually used by people who don't have a clue about programming (e.g. HR personnel and poor managers). Alternatively, it's used by people who simple do not know C++ (and often not C either). When used by programmers, it typically indicates a "C++ is C with a few useful and a lot of useless complicated features added" attitude. Often, that is the point of view of people who like to write their own strings and hash tables with little knowledge of the standard library beyond printf and memcpy.**Edit: I see this issue spawned a quite discussion. Just noting that the goal of this issue is to stop using "C/C++" term. Currently the Dev Ops chart uses this as 1 language.**
See arbor.js for inspiration or a mindmap.Great idea!
can anyone make a network roadmap for beginners?
Can you create a roadmap for Software QA?

From react [docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/test-utils.html)> Note:> We recommend using React Testing Library which is designed to enable and encourage writing tests that use your components as the end users do.> Alternatively, Airbnb has released a testing utility called Enzyme, which makes it easy to assert, manipulate, and traverse your React Components’ output.
Android Developer Roadmap
I think learning Web security as a Frontend Developer / Engineer will be valuable.
Hi, it may be useful to create a QA engineer roadmap as well.
Can be very awesome create a roadmap for cyber security beginners. 
Sass has officially never been all caps. Similar to how npm is never NPM.
SVG Icons VS Font Icons are common tech skills required for most of frontend project. 
A mobile developer roadmap would add a good complement to the actual state of this project.
The scope covers to much extent the end to end web development road-map. What do you think about a roadmap for **Linux Kernel Developer**?
Animations and responsiveness with combination of SVG(Scalable Vector Graphics), CSS and Javascript is kind of cool for front end developer. I think it would be great to add it to the roadmap after CSS and basic javascript.
It is interesting how much abstraction has grown between the developer and the underlying hardware their code is running on. Much of it was necessary to get to where we are today. But have we reached an inflection point where there is so much cruft in the layers of abstraction that we have created more problems (not just security) than we can cope with plus a "too big to fail" mentality creeping in?While may not be in the scope of a web developer, perhaps a parking lot should be created for all the dependencies a web developer has outside of their scope especially with on-premise, hybrid, and multi-cloud environments.
It'd be cool if you added knowledge of:* async code * bash scripts * CRON jobs* also base knowledge of JS, html, css--> into backend roadmap
I am not sure if it is front or back i consider it a totally different thing which deserves attention and some facts about it should be shared in roadmap 
Imagine you want to hang those on your desk or hand them in lectures, it is hard to get them printed because there is no clear places to split them to pages and they sure don't fit in standard paper size.It would be useful and it might even cause them to get more popular.

If you print a roadmap on a standard laser printer the symbols look very similar in color which obscures your recommendations.* Put a little more space in the diagrams so they can be cleanly printed in pieces for training purposes, either for slide presentations or for a handout.Thanks again for your great work! <!-- Please enter the issue details here -->

Hi y’all, I hope everyone here are well with all these things happening in the world.I just wanna ask why I found nothing about algorithm in back end developer roadmap...I’ve been working as backend about 5 years and nowadays I see algorithms as the most relevant subject to get a job in a relevant tech company, at least where I live (Brazil).

Hello, I love this repository and I recommend it to a lot of people, mainly beginners. Some of them can't read in english and it's very frustrating for me being unable to provide this quality of content for them in our native language (PT-br).My question is: how can I contribute with this repository with translations? Is there a official way to do that? Or may I fork the project (leaving the canonical references) and just go on?Sorry if this was answered here before or if it's present in any docs, I've searched for it and found nothingThank you anyway for this initiative and have a great day

So, I suggest there could be a list of suggested projects at each stage to help junior developers measure their progress, and articulate their skills better (sort of like gamifying it). This also helps bring juniors to build more momentum as they would feel that they completed milestones along the way, rather looking at it as a long tough road. Plus, pointing the purpose of concepts can also help make juniors really understand why concepts/techniques could help make their workflow better. These are just some suggestions. Hopefully, it can help. I appreciate Mr.Ahmed and everyone for helping to build this wonderful project.

Wouldn't recommend anyone investing on it nowadays.Proposition:**NoSQL Databases** - Document (MongoDB, CouchDB...) - K/V Datastores (Redis) - Column (Cassandra) - Timeseries (InfluxDB) - Realtime DBs (Firebase, RethinkDB) - Object Storage (S3, Ceph...)

Screen readers generally do not interact with images at all.I am opening this discussion to ask if plain text versions of these roadmaps could be made. I think this will help others in my situation and perhaps search engine discovery is a bonus.I am able to do some analysis of the JSON data, which is helpful to some extent. However, it would be ideal if I could go through the list without parsing through all the code.I realize there are probably some complex relationships here, but I was thinking we could leverage headings, lists, ASCII chars to represent arrows, etc.Thank you for considering and I would be happy to contribute in some way (such as find way to parse JSON data in code to generate markdown files).

If you reach out to me with a brief detail of why and how you would liketo use this content, there is a good chance that I will allow you to use it. The reasonbehind this strictness in the license is to stop the people who have been using theseroadmaps in ill manners e.g. ripping people off with suggesting random affiliate links,redistributing these roadmaps just for the sake of monetizing the traffic.I have tried contacting you privately (few emails, few tweets) but since it's open source might as well do it publiclyI currently teach some classes at a french university (not private)I thought the roadmap was a pretty good idea and I'd like to include it in a project of mine, and then distribute it to students The project would be open source, with the same licence as yours to be as compliant as possible. The project itself is a website to display the roadmap in a canvas, instead of a PNG, and allow my users to click on the skills that they think they know, which would color the boxes in various colors depending on how they click, and user could export this as a PNG & a Json to share the state of their current knowledge with others. This could be useful for a number of things, including assessing before a class the current knowledge of students It could have ads depending on hosting, or something else to cover the server costs (maybe sponsors if a company is interested...) so I think this falls under "commercial use" and is prevented by the licence unless I'm given explicit permission from the licence holderSo I'm coming here to ask for permission. Would you be okay with me using the project, mainly your json files?Thank you

And some people have [shown that it is indeed possible](https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/myprojects/mit-challenge-2/). A roadmap would shed light onto what one needs to learn.- I would also argue that some colleges do a poor job of guiding students through the way, and they would benefit from having a concrete framework/roadmap to guide them.

Any thoughts? (:This idea came to me from the recent vulnerability in Log4J. I've seen some companies that used it changing their logging frameworks entirely instead of updating, and SLF4J is quite useful at that.

I’m no expert, but I was thinking that it would make sense to include a node or two about UI and UX design in the front end developer roadmap. This could include things like page design, structure, and other topics like that. Plus also the tooling to help mockup and test designs like Figma or XD. I think those things are pretty useful in becoming a successful front end developer.

Some of its uses are in telecoms, banking, e-commerce, computer telephony and instant messaging. - https://www.erlang.org/While initially built to tackle the requirements for the telecoms sector, we now have the same requirements for any (large scale) web application. Erlang comes with its own virtual machine (BEAM) and standard library (OTP) and is considered the most stable platform on the planet [[1]], running huge chunks of our internet, mobile phone and other telecommunications infrastructure.Elixir makes the strengths of Erlang more accessible with a nicer syntax and handy additions on top.Both [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/) and it's web framework [Phoenix](https://www.phoenixframework.org/) have been around and tested for quite some time and and there are tons of resources. Check out the Phoenix Framework web page to see the creation of a twitter-ish application including live UI updates across browsers in 15 minutes or [livebeats](https://livebeats.fly.dev/larshei).By now, I have built a hand full web services with Elixir, and where things in other languages become difficult, erlang/elixir really shine (all those servers and services are clustered for example, without and extra tools). Some of the open source projects done by the community (and the community itself) are just awesome.Elixir and Erlang are used by companies like- Discord- Ericson- Financial Times- Goldmann Sachs- PepsiCo- Pinterest- RabbitMQ -> itself powers a lot of the financial messaging on this planet- Solaris Bank- Spotify- WhatsApp- ...[1]: https://www.seppmed.de/elixir-zaubertrank-fuer-digitalisierung/

I was wondering if we wanted to change the boxes, arrows, and text on any roadmap, do we need to edit the JSON file manually, e.g. `public/project/frontend.json`?Is there any tool to facilitate this?In the contribution docs, it states `Please provide a rough textual roadmap with what you have in mind with an issue and we can take it from there`. But can we add new roadmaps on a local copy of the repo, without submitting an issue? To simply get it working locally then download an image with the roadmap.I know how to change the content of the nodes with markdown. Just asking about the JSON roadmap file 🙂.Any help is very much appreciated 👍,Thanks!<!-- Please enter the issue details here -->

Cool

I'd like to suggest the addition of gofiber(https://gofiber.io/) to the list of webfameworks as it's the fastest one in its field and is great for people used to express. It also offers many useful pre-made middlewares like a jwt validatorEDIT: sorry for not using the template, it doesn't work on the mobile version

There are a couple of libs for FE to consume it and there is a very consolidated lib for C# to implement it. I know it's a more C# oriented solution, but I think it makes sense to be there. With that said, I think is a little bit more straightforward than GraphQL actually, once it's a well-implemented tool. However, the result of both is very similar.Here is a good document comparing both https://www.educba.com/odata-vs-graphql/Well, one more thought I think that could be helpful for everybody who likes this kind of solution. Best regards.

Take for example this one: https://github.com/kripken/ammo.js/blob/main/ammo.idlThis comes from the ammo js library, an advanced physics engine written in C++ ported over to JavaScript. JavaScript developers stand in the unique position of mainly using high-level abstractions when interacting with code; they don't interact with pointers, or even need to worry about memory cleanup (for the most part), but they can also tap into the powerful processing power and speed of lower level languages such as C++ or precompiled binaries such as WASM using IDLs. I think more web developers should be aware of these tools and adding this to your list of covered topics would be a huge benefit or developers in general who want a guided approach to learning about them.

Developer-roadmap is such a large project and there are so many individuals ready to help out and improve it, I'm writing this to say that I believe we all need a common platform where the community can engage with one another, like Discord, Slack, etc. This will not only facilitate organised community effort but also encourage participation from newcomers to the open source community. The roadmap materials will be improved with discussion and collaboration on a single platform, and new features will be released more quickly.Please do consider this could be really beneficial for this amazing project 😇@kamranahmedse I have messaged you for the same on twitter

https://roadmap.sh/golangI would like to know if you are making that roadmap interactive. If you have a guide how to do it, I can do it and submit a PR.Thanks
Hi There, Technical Oversight Committee (TOC) has approved the archiving of the OpenTracing project and following the merger of OpenTracing & OpenCensus into OpenTelemetry. So it's considerable to replace OpenTracing with OpenTelemetry.Ref: https://www.cncf.io/blog/2022/01/31/cncf-archives-the-opentracing-project/OpenTelemetry is an open source project that replaces OpenTracing and OpenCensus.This open standards covers a broader scopes from specifications, APIs, libraries, integrations, e.t.c for different programming languages.
I don't see svelte listed. I think it should be.￼
**What is this issue about?**> Requesting new Map for DevSecOps**Enter the details about the issue here**> I understand that there is already an open security issue for the backend path(https://github.com/kamranahmedse/developer-roadmap/issues/750) and DevOps Path(https://github.com/kamranahmedse/developer-roadmap/issues/1079).Along side, it would be nice to have a separate roadmap for DevSecOps. So we could cover detailed topics on security.Some reference links for DevSecOps, I found on internethttps://www.aquasec.com/cloud-native-academy/devsecops/devsecops/https://www.aquasec.com/cloud-native-academy/devsecops/devsecops-tools/https://www.tigera.io/learn/guides/devsecops/https://www.atlassian.com/devops/devops-tools/devsecops-toolshttps://mindmajix.com/security-devops-toolshttps://www.beyondtrust.com/resources/glossary/devops-security

If possible do make it like the other roadmaps it will be more convinient.Thank you.
Hey I think it would be great if you also include [Chainstack](https://chainstack.com/) in **Node as a Service** section. If it is fine, I can also open a PR with more information :)


I wish if each step have its recommended course/source.
I love the idea of roadmap.sh but I wonder if there was an idea to create an interactive roadmap maker? To make it possible for individual creators to create their own roadmaps.Was there thought given to this idea before? Or something similar out there? Thank you!
First of all: really love those roadmaps! They are awesome!`logrus`: I know it's still the first choice by people or companies coming to Go but there are faster and better ones now. As is stated on the readme, logrus is in maintainance mode. https://github.com/sirupsen/logrus#logrus----> There doesn't seem to be a reason to do a major, breaking iteration into Logrus V2, since the fantastic Go community has built those independently. Many fantastic alternatives have sprung up. Logrus would look like those, had it been re-designed with what we know about structured logging in Go today. Check out, for example, [Zerolog](https://github.com/rs/zerolog), [Zap](https://github.com/uber-go/zap), and [Apex](https://github.com/apex/log).
I'd like to contribute to devOps and sysOps roadmap. 

Greetings! I was wondering if you folks could add a dark theme option in the whole project, not only at the homepage.It would be much more sight soothing for us with tired eyes 😅
Hey! Im reviewing the react native part of the "Front End Roadmap" and i found out, it has a duplicated link![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/75400668/187038198-727499d4-ed1f-4732-b045-87800195721e.png)Here, the last two links reference the same video, may be the seccond one could be reused, but with a link like:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hPgQWbWmEk&thttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ivIUCSOZ78Thanks!
It will be very nice if user was able to export roadmap in check-list
Determinate requirements for junior, mid-level, and senior Backend and Frontend
It will be very nice to add Redux Thunk and Redux Saga as child of Redux meaning advanced knowledge of asynchronous state management
I am not able to download it in pdf format.
Hi, thank you for these amazing ressources!I suggest to replace http with https in the link. It's a nitpick but for some reason it scares me. What do you think?![Screenshot 2022-08-31 at 10 39 14](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49123231/187635741-106c0713-14ce-458c-93dc-335cd12e6ac5.png)
Hi, I very like the beautiful roadmap, I want to know how to impl such svg clickable roadmap. Do you have any plan to make the roadmap-renderer to public？ Thanks very much.
Hi, the work you're doing is impressive.I'm suggesting a few points to add to the module section of the JavaScript roadmap.1. How to import and export modules 2. default and named exportsThank you for instituting roadmap dot sh.
Good work you are doing on this project. I was going through the codebase locally and I noticed that roadmap IDs were hardcoded array within isInteractiveRoadmap() located in [roadmap.ts](https://github.com/kamranahmedse/developer-roadmap/blob/master/lib/roadmap.ts).I would like to know if that is done deliberately or if I could add a change to that so it gets an array of roadmap IDs dynamically.

I am a self taught developer and I have used this tool to guide me learn. I am referring it now for my friends and I wanted to contribute in adding resources as well helping fix issues. 
Hi, I just wanted to let you know that the content of the pdf file available for download does not correspond to the content on the online roadmap. Maybe the file has simply not been updated, but the actual page has...Thanks for your awesome work! 
Please add cyber security and ethical hacking roadmap.
Give us a list of Data structure and Algorithms in the DataStructures tab of Java roadmap or separately make a roadmap on it..
I think this section has many groups of stuff.For example: Storage, Web Sockets, Lighthouse and others could be individual "tasks" instead of one big task.It makes marking what you've studied easier :)![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/85039990/188191541-c4d088fa-ce21-42bd-9222-582695a42928.png)
So far, the roadmap looks great. But we feel that a little bit more could be added regarding the HTML DOM and the CSSOM APIs. No one can neglect the importance of the DOM and the CSSOM in JavaScript.
Add packages like net, net/http, io, and so on
Hey I just subscribed your website but I still couldn't get the download link.Can you help me with that? Thank you very much!!

please add vitest in testing section 
Hi, I'm unable to download the Roadmaps. When I click on the download link, it says "This email address has already been subscribed". But I could not receive the download link in my email inbox.
It would be a nice touch if we could filter based on the checkmark color.My thought is that clicking the checkmark in the legend at the top would show/hide the items in the roadmap below based on the check. 
Headless Testing is a child element of Test Automation and should be placed before CI, because we believe that E2E testing embedded in CI is basically Headless. What do you think?
Way to make a user account and save "Mark as Done"
Maybe we should have Jetpack Compose as a must, Thoughtworks's [Tech Radar 25](https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/languages-and-frameworks/jetpack-compose) (2021 October) added Jetpack Compose as technology that should be adopted on new projects
Hi, I wish could add `pnpm` to the part of package managers in frontend roadmap as `pnpm` gets more popular. I used `pnpm` in my project, it is an amazing package manager.
Its returning the 404 error on the website https://roadmap.sh/Request URL: https://roadmap.sh/Request Method: GETStatus Code: 404 Remote Address: 185.199.111.153:443
You can add `pnpm` to Package Managers list in the FrontEnd Roadmap. 
Can we also add some sense of time each of these items will take or usually take? I know this is very subjective but it will give an important perspective to anyone who wants to prioritise things
Hi,First of all thanks for the greate content you provide as roadmap. I was waiting for QA roadmoap for so long.I can not see selenium there. Just curious about why it is not there.Thanks
Inclusion of Handlebars in `Templating engine` the NodeJs roadmap will be a welcome addition. I'll personally work on updating it in very simplified and educating way.
The color legends between Concept and Tools look the same, maybe the Tools legend color needs to be darker in color. So people can see the difference.

Hello, would it be possible to add a feature to keep the nodes marked as done saved? Because if I leave the roadmap website, or clear the browser's history,  it does not keep the nodes I had previously marked as done saved. So I would appreciate if you guys could somehow make a change to keep those nodes marked as done saved, so we can keep track of our study. Another thing, would be possible to create a specific roadmap about Flask and Django? If I am not asking too much 😅

i would add vite support and modules deployment, know the distinct deployment needs and restrictionsand how to replace inline-templates with outside of app data
maybe add some kind of sso knoledge, even some like openid and oauth flows
For testing library I would suggest the **Playwright Framework** for testing E2E web application as a replacement for Cypress because of the funtionalites it provide, and **vitest** as replacement for jest because it have the same maintainer as Vue are

I would like to add Containerization section in Backend roadmap along side with Cloud Providers section.If you can tell me how can I add new section then  I would love to work on it.

I go through roadmaps but it seems machine learning roadmap is not present so I love to add that !
I would love to add a roadmap for Spring boot developers.Do let me know if this is something which interests others.
Imho putting testing at the end of the roadmap is wrong. It should be placed just after fundamentals. Maybe not all advanced topics like TDD, BDD, mutation testing etc, but basics like unit testing. Maybe split testing into basic of testing covering unit testing, mocking, maybe even TDD and advanced testing

I would like to add roadmap for cybersecurity, CTF, and related stuff
Can add a Roadmap for Data Science
Consider adding Kyle Simpson's [You Don't Know JS Yet (book series)](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS). I didn't find it on the roadmap and I believe it would be a great addition to the JavaScript-related roadmaps. It's a series of books diving deep into the core mechanisms of the JavaScript language and it's available freely on GitHub.
A career in Developer Relations is quite sought after. I can add content for a Developer Advocate / Developer Evangelist roadmap
What roadmap is this issue about?- [ ] Frontend Roadmap- [ ] Backend Roadmap- [ ] DevOps Roadmap- [ ] All Roadmaps- [x] None of the aboveWhat is this issue about?- [ ] Discussion for a pull request I would want to open.- [x] Addition of a new item- [ ] Removal of some existing item- [ ] Changing in arrangement- [ ] General suggestion- [ ] Sharing an Idea- [ ] Something elsePlease acknowledge the below listed- [x] This is not a duplicate issue. I have searched and there is no existing issue for this.- [x] I understand that these roadmaps are highly opinionated. The purpose is to not to include everything out there in these roadmaps but to have everything that is most relevant today comparing to the other options listed.- [x] I have read the [contribution docs](https://github.com/kamranahmedse/developer-roadmap/contributing.md) before opening this issue.Enter the details about the issue here- A role in Developer Relations is very sought after especially for generalists. - With a lot of tools focusing on developers as the users, more and more companies have started feeling the need for a developer relations team- Until 5 years ago, Developer Evangelism was meant for someone who usually has an experience of 15+ years. But now you can get involved in this career track early on in your career. I can cover the following topics and hoping that others can contribute too.- Introduction to Developer Relations  -  What is Developer Relations?  -  Why do companies need developer relations  -  What do developer relations teams do?  - Roles in Developer Relations    - Developer Advocate    - Developer Evangelist    - Developer Marketing    - Developer Community Manager- Skills   - Content writing  - Documentation  - Creating Demos  - Working with APIs  - Public Speaking  - Product Feedback

Hi @kamranahmedse ,1) Do you think Data structures / Algorithms would be important for this role?2) In the Web/Mobile section, can we elaborate a little more like what tech stack would be required for mobile?3) Can we also expand the Cloud Providers section and also include the related certifications?Thank you.
**Rationale**QA professionals, especially those working in `Performance Engineering and Testing` negates the term `Non-Functional`. The rationale behind is: the term `performance` is `functional` for any application. Similarly for [`Accessbility Testing`](https://web.dev/accessible/), [`Security Testing`](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/), and more.![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2826376/193952008-7fd668db-fc00-4d68-92ef-76d1b6848306.png)AFAIK, there is no official term for `Non-Functional Testing` or `Non-Functional Requirements`. Industry leaders James Bach, Cem Kaner, Alexander Podelko and more agrees that the term misrepresents the testing objective.So, I am proposing to change the term to `Extra-Funcational`. Credits to [James Bach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Marcus_Bach). @kamranahmedse Please share your inputs as well. I can make a PR to change it everywhere. Thanks!
The command to initialise a react app could be added <a href='https://github.com/kamranahmedse/developer-roadmap/blob/master/content/roadmaps/103-react/content/100-react-fundamental-topics/100-create-react-app.md'>here</a>.  This describes Create React Appas CLI based tool and way to start building a new single-page application in React. But I think it would be also great to added with what command it could be initialised.
Developer Relations, or DevRel, is an umbrella term that refers to strategies and techniques for fostering connections between businesses and developers (such as software developers), who are a product's primary users and frequently its purchasers, in a way that is mutually beneficial.

I would like to integrate `greetings.yml` action workflow in this project so that whenever any new contributor raises their PR or creates a new issue they should be greetedI would like to request the maintainers to label this issue as hacktoberfest as I am contributing to this issue as a part of the hacktoberfest.😄
The top youtube link bar is a bit annoying because you can not remove it There should a close button to remove the top bar ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/83518670/194774857-52dd5ac2-6b73-4d2e-9036-d02fb310e366.png)
React native is a very popular mobile development framework for creating user interfaces for IOS and Android devices.Hence I am really interested in contributing to this project by creating a subtle and straightforward roadmap for developers to get started with React Native.
Do you know where ASYNCH FETCH API is located? If not, then can you please included it.  Great roadmap though, definitely will try it!

Add contents of `DBMS-RoadMap`
I am unable to zoom the page to see the details of roadmap clearly in my mobile browser
Its just a Article's sugestI think it article would be more suitable, at least as a complement`https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/what-are-observables-how-they-are-different-from-promises/`
I want to add roadmap for flutter developer
Typo in Design principles topic: **_Program against abstarction_** : Program against abstraction 
Content Addition to nodejs roadmapPR with #2579 solves this issuePlease have a look.
As Security, I would include a skillset for Performance Engineering: This Skillset could include: SLAs, SLOs, SLIs + KPIs + Non-Functional requirements + CPT + automation + Performance Testing strategies or Types for the Backend and the Frontend among others
- add https://testomat.io as test management system. - add https://codecept.io/ to test automation tools
On "Testing your apps" is said to study the technologies on the left, but it should be right.<img width="1026" alt="Screen Shot 2022-10-20 at 18 00 16" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24324267/197057143-b192362a-9ba4-4608-9121-300884462ed9.png">
Hello @kamranahmedse , Are you going to add SASS/CSS Pre-processor to the Frontend Developer roadmap?.Might it help other developers. Thanks
## Open Source roadmap- Introduction to Open Source  - What is Open Source?  - The need to contribute to open source  - Benefits of Open Source Projects  - Organizations Involved with Open Source software and projects- Getting Started with Contributing   - Ways to contribute      - Code      - Design      - Project Management      - Language Translation      - Technical Writing/Documentation      - Community Building    - Tools to get you started       - Git       - GitHub - Open Source Communities   - Python Software Community   - Java Community   - Kubernetes and CloudNative Community   - GitHub   - freeCodeCamp   - Open Source Design   - Write the Docs- Resources   - Books   - Websites   - Newsletters  
There is issue #2167, which has been completed with no comments.As an OpenSource DevRel, I help people to follow my steps, but I only have 24h per day, and a lot of people want to become an OpenSource DevRel to create and empower communities around OpenSource projects.A DevRel OpenSource roadmap would help tens of thousands of people around the world to create communities.I know it's not an easy task, but I would really like to contribute and bring more open-source contributors to make this roadmap happen.Let's discuss, even a "no" is appreciated and will help the community, as I will share the reasoning and explain what was my mistake.
The number **107** as repeated for both **nodejs and android** folderI can try to solve this problem
- raised PR https://github.com/kamranahmedse/developer-roadmap/pull/2708
Hi, I recently checked if I could translate something in this repo, I found this link https://github.com/kamranahmedse/developer-roadmap/tree/0471d44c8fae58b6a36a7c57bba12253916d0249/translations which shows the languages ​​already translated, also at the bottom of the page there is a link that allows you to send your own translation, but it leads to a deleted page, making the translation impossible for those who want to do it.I am new to contributing to Open Source projects and if possible I can help :)
Learning can be much faster when understood by solving relevant problems . In the language roadmaps in free content we can add links to relevant questions to make the roadmaps more wholesome and useful. 
Any chances to add a dark mode to change the theme colors, everything is kinda bright 
Having some kind of a progress indicator would be nice, could be a pie chart or even a linear bar, that indicates how many nodes have been marked 
Would like to suggest a new roadmap for VLSI Design and Verification_Hardware Engineers are very underpresentated imo_
Update CentOs mention as CentOS 8 and future versions have been discontinued. You mention those in the detailed text but the label on the roadmap has not been updated.
It would be nice to be able to add as another State management Flutter Bloc

I would state that OCI - Oracle Cloud Interesting - would be another addition to the cloud service providers line up. Many of the same functionality that is available in AWS and Azure is available in OCI.

why don't you add the topic servlet and jsp ,becaucse this is the  basic thing for a beginner when they entering into java EE 
Please add a Sharepoint roadmap. I can contribute a bit
It will be interesting to add new topics and tools under,- Codeless automation- Visual Testing
[The npx Node.js Package Runner](https://nodejs.dev/en/learn/the-npx-nodejs-package-runner) is not available. Its from the node.js roadmap. Its in the npx.
According to links under Browser Addons in #2880 seems like the tool is called Bug Magnet and not Bug Management like it currently says on the website.Do you think if this should be updated? I can make a PR for this.
Checkout this page and update the changes: https://roadmap.sh/javascript"Find the detailed version of this roadmap along with resources and other roadmaps". This box has "http://roadmap.sh", change this to "https://roadmap.sh".When I click on @subscribe button, the text contains "Enter your below to receive updates to this roadmap" which needs to change to "Enter your email below to receive updates to this roadmap."
First, thank you for your effort and for providing us with such great roadmaps with different resources. I think from my previous experience in software testing we need to differentiate between QA engineer, Test Automation Engineer, and SDET (Software Engineer in Test) because each role has different responsibilities and skills. I'm happy to help if you'd like. Thanks
For State Management, we could add MobX and Riverpod.Besides that, we could add a list for responsive widgets (LayoutBuilder for example) and a Desktop/web roadmaps, with the Fluent Widgets (Windows desktop). 
Tracing and Metrics are missing.- [ ] Tracing  - [ ] OpenTelemetry    - [ ] Grafana Tempo    - [ ] Jaeger    - [ ] Zipkin- [ ] Metrics  - [ ] OpenTelemetry    - [ ] Grafana Mimir    - [ ] PrometheusAlso, I would add the following too- Log Management System  - [ ] Grafana Loki

Would recommend removing Enzyme since this is being deprecated with React18?
Hello, the project looks amazingAlthough, I missed the topic about 3D, before all these AI+AR buzz techs like [WebGL](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGL_API) where been used a lot, libs like Three.js are like an important topic today so my suggestion is to add a WebGL topic.sources: - https://www.npmjs.com/package/three- https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebXR_Device_API- https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGL_API
Peer-to-peer distributed Storage Protocol or more likely IPFS was missing!Hello, the blockchain Roadmap looks pretty much resourceful, But I saw that distributed storage wasn't mentioned as long as I noticed. Storage is quite expensive in blockchain, and developer should use P2P storage/file sharing protocol like IPFS, and other options as needed for the sake of decentralization.
I am running second year of <let's take non-IT people and raise them to junior tester> type of initiative in my companyfrom the roadmap, I see a couple of basic soft skills missing that I teach that help you being much better tester, since they allow you to understand and ask the <why> questionsthe short list encompasses:: tacit knowledge identification and transfer:: mind modelling:: business case value identification:: risk analysis (and DFMEA in the process even though they are very different animal):: effective exploration note-taking:: quality criteria:: understanding user interfaces:: later, shift (spread) left
Hi! I would like to help .net get an idea about mutation testing. I can create aa node about it with Stryker library suggestion with materials.Let me know if you want me to add this.
It says:"Oops! There's an error Try refreshing or [report a bug] and use the [non-interactive version]"I cleared cache and restarted my browser with no luck.

On the backend roadmap, Mercurial is listed in the resources. It's not listed in the frontend map for example, and it's presence there might be confusing to newcomers. Should it be removed?

forget, what i means is already implanted.
can you make cookies or some cool design that tracks progress throughout the journey w cookies or sum? It would also be nice to see how far I've come every time I come back to the topic
How about add Setup Developer Env in FVM (Flutter version manager)andPlease add Riverpod at State Management.
- Add GitOps Concept as a topic  - Add ArgoCD, FluxCD as Tools- Add Secret Management as Concept  - e.g. Vault, Cloud Specific Tools, SealedSecrets ... 
add sveltekit to ssr frameworks as it is almost hitting v1 and will probably become a lot more popular afterwards
Fastapi should be there on python  developer roadmap.

hello team, one quick UI suggesstion if we can implement is that - lets say in React Developer roadmap, for **every sub-main heading**, e.g _Routers, SSR/SSG, State management_ etc, can we have **unique color** other then light brown, to highlight i such a way that its the part of **ecosystem** of react.<img width="125" alt="Screenshot 2022-11-26 at 8 26 47 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61886678/204095236-295bf411-65e1-4092-abe9-e6933c139d22.png">
It would be great if you could log your completion for each section, possibly using local storage?EDIT: Just saw the mark as complete button, sorry! 😄 
Good day! I want to add a node next to Solana dedicated to TON.Recently, it has been increasingly mentioned and is beginning to be used by applications with a large user base. Telegram, for example.![изображение](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20744932/204238241-65dfd5cb-355d-4806-bfe8-38da2e2386fe.png)I have prepared everything necessary to add TON to the roadmap.

Add Cheat-Sheet too in this website
I have created a PR for a GraphQL roadmap teaser here: #3026.As per the [contribution document's new roadmap section](https://github.com/kamranahmedse/developer-roadmap/blob/master/contributing.md#new-roadmaps), here's the textual roadmap representation:_* I would create the actual roadmap myself, but I don't really know how to._- Introduction to GraphQL  - What is GraphQL?  - What problems does GraphQL solve?  - Thinking in graphs  - On the frontend  - On the backend- Queries  - What are queries?  - Fields  - Aliases  - Arguments  - Variables    - Definitions    - Defaults  - Fragments    - Using variables inside fragments    - Inline Fragments      - Meta fields  - Directives- Mutations  - What are mutations?  - Multiple fields in mutations  - Operation Name- Subscriptions  - What are subscriptions?  - Event based subscriptions  - Live queries  - `@defer` and `@stream` directives- Schema  - Type System  - Fields  - Scalars    - Int    - Float    - String    - Boolean    - ID  - Enums  - Objects  - Lists  - Interfaces  - Unions  - Arguments    - Input types- Validation- Execution  - Root fields  - Resolvers    - Synchronous    - Asynchronous    - Scalar coercion    - Lists  - Validation  - Producing the result- Serving over internet  - Over HTTP    - GraphQL over HTTP specification    - Caching    - Batching    - Authorization  - Over WebSockets    - GraphQL over WebSocket specification    - Real-time    - Authorization  - Over SSE    - GraphQL over Server-Sent Events specification    - Authorization- Pagination- Backend implementations  - JavaScript    - graphql-http    - GraphQL Yoga    - Apollo Server    - mercurius- Frontend implementations  - JavaScript    - graphql-http    - Relay    - Apollo Client    - UrqlI've noticed you guys are using [balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com) for the roadmaps, but how do you convert it to JSON?

Server-side rendering technologies should also include SvelteKit, as Svelte is included in the "Pick a Framework" section.

If you write down Selenium, Playwright and Cypress for Frontend tAutomated Testing I would suggest Sahi Pro from Tyto Software also, because it is for mobile, Web, desktop, (headleass or not, with docker or not) and it builds on business-driven test automation (near to BDD) - that is the key. We need to use business processes as root for our test cases as we do in BDD/ATDD/BDTA.

Hello,I would like to suggest including the tool **Testmo** under the "Mange your Testing" node, as it is the standard unified testing tool to manage all manual test cases, exploratory tests and automated testing in one system. It is also listed as one of the major tools in the [Guru99 listing](https://www.guru99.com/testing-tools.html) which is often used for reference here, among others. I suggest using the following text and reference links:-----TestmoTestmo is a unified test management tool. Software testing teams use it to manage their manual test cases, exploratory test sessions and test automation. Teams can design test cases, start test runs and enter test results. Test sessions can be used to manage exploratory and usability tests. And automated test results can be submitted from test automation tools to track and report results.Links / content:Official website: https://www.testmo.com/Testmo example projects and code repositories: https://github.com/testmoapp
Please make the primitive type "Mark as Done" option separately for all these topics:- stringnumberbigintbooleanundefinedSymbolnullAs Symbol is an Intermediate Topic, not all users can complete this topic (Symbol) at once. To keep track of completion Primitive Types it would be easier to mark them as done individually. 
Hi, just wondering when this roadmap will get interactive nodes?
Hi, I have a question and I hope you can answer I was studying cse in India But due to some financial circumstances that happened to me, I was unable to complete my education. I finished the first year only. Knowing that I love the field very much and want to learn to program Should I start with the cs50 course? Although I want to have a source of income from the field, I can learn more and develop more
Hi @kamranahmedse, how about adding Key-Value Store to the NoSQL Databases topic, using Redis as an example?
Could we add **animation section** for react web apps. Check out below links if we can look and add them into it?React Transition group - https://reactcommunity.org/react-transition-group/React motion - https://github.com/chenglou/react-motionReact spring - https://github.com/pmndrs/react-springReact move - https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-moveReact router transition - https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-router-transition
please add R 

**superagent package for REST API calls of Vue roadmap is died. please edit**`https://visionmedia.github.io/superagent/`
It would be fantastic to do a roadmap for PHP (it is one of the top languages)  mobile application development, desktop application development and game development 
For frameworks, Spark is kind of in a weird place right now. Last I checked, this framework is in hiatus and its developer hasn't had time to update it even though there was mention of him trying to get back to it a few years ago. I would think this is is sort of a dead framework.Instead, may I recommend the more active Javalin framework? It's basically a fork of Spark and is just as easy to learn (has Kotlin support too).
For Static Site Generators, Gridsome, although it still works, is not recommended in my opinion because it's been abandoned for almost three years and shows no signs of coming out of Beta. This left a lot of developers burned because we built a lot of websites with this tool, plus there are some bugs that still need to be addressed. I would say I don't recommend this at all for new projects, but may still be a good option for very simple sites, so maybe mark it with gray checkmark?In it's place, I would recommend Astro as it recently hit 1.0, is backed by Vercel and other companies, and is framework agnostic. Much better DX in my opinion.Also you could add Server Sent Events next to Web Sockets as they are an alternate way to receive a stream of data using just http requests as opposed to implementing an entire web socket server.
Hi,Is Prism framework in the ASP.NET Core Developer roadmap?https://prismlibrary.com/And Blazor Server, Blazor WebAssembly as well not in roadmap.Thanks for getting ASP.NET Core in the roadmap. This really a great work.
The [roadmap](https://roadmap.sh/vue) recommends to learn Vue CLI though it is in the maintenance mode now according to the [docs](https://cli.vuejs.org/#getting-started). I presume it would be more approprite to change the Vue CLI note to new two separate records pointing to [create-vue](https://github.com/vuejs/create-vue) and [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) as they replace Vue CLI in combination.
Status management should add both swr and zustand
Hi, This is a great source, I'd like to say thanks to all the people behind it!! A suggestion I wanna submit for consideration: Add database/sql querying 
Create the option to save progress on website roadmap when items are marked as completed
Like github or google OAuth
It is asking me to subscribe when I try to download. but I am already subscribed.
Flutter is now a viable option for creating desktop applications. Would recommend adding to the Frontend>Desktop Applications topic as an alternative to Electron.https://flutter.dev/multi-platform/desktopThanks for the great work on roadmap.sh
Hello, I found it so daisy to mark the things that I complete I have to click on itthen I look for the marking button, I just want to mention that I discovered it after I decided to build an copy to track my progress.My recommendations, is to make a progress bar for more engagement, we can use the Local storage for that but it will be not good enough as we need to track that progress over many devices, I know there's maybe limitations as these required a back end services.But the small change will make different rn is to easy marking the topicmaybe two click or hold or left click. so I'm working currently on this and let me know if it's okay to send the PR
It would be helpful is you slightly adjust the font color or better add a night mode toggle. I use a third party forced dark mode and  no words are visible of the main content.![Screenshot (13)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63013668/207434390-f7453116-2513-49df-ad2f-5efad16e1a6a.png) 
I think it might be helpful if this beautiful site can incorporate printable formats to its road maps along with checkboxes to track progress.Thanks. 
Please create a login id and password to this road map so that we can track our road map as to what is completed and what is pending just a suggestion or Please tell me if its already executed and  I am missing something here
They're not worst- and best-case scenarios, they're upper and lower bounds. Each x-case scenario has a separate O and Ω. The Θ is a bit unclear as well.
Hi author, thank you for your sharing. I think you can add csrf into security topic because it is very common. https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/csrf
Add typescript for languages to learn, getting really popular and works with existing javascript ecosystems.
Hi,I have few suggestions: 1) Remove:`airmon` and `airodump`Reason: those are fairly "niche" utilities2) Remove `mtr`Reason: it is OK to know traceroute and ping2) Change `ufw` to `ufw/firewalld`Reason: `firewalld` is firewall manager in Fedora derivatives3) Change `iptables` to `iptables/nftables`4) Merge HTTPS with `SSL/TLS`, making it `HTTPS/TLS`5) Replace `FTP` with `SFTP`6) Remove `egrep/fgrep`, because there are `grep -E` and `grep -F`7) Change `CentOS`, `Fedora` `RHEL` to `RHEL/derivatives (e.g.AlmaLinux), Fedora`Reason: CentOS going to Stream makes AlmaLinux/RockyLinux a free alternative to RHEL8) Group `Ubuntu` and `Debian` to `Ubuntu/Debian`More controversial: 3) Potentially to be removed:-Mesos-Salt (which should be SaltStack)-Caddy -Unix (entire section)Reason: too low adoption.4) -Remove Rust, C, C++-Potentially remove `Javascript/Node.js` and maybe `Ruby`...Reason: it doesn't fit well to **DevOps** Roadmap(Bash,Python is much-much more important in this context, Go will stay because of Kubernetes)

_Ash's Notes - I think testability would be an excellent addition to the QA Roadmap, in the 'Learn the Fundamentals' section. I'm happy to do the PR, if it is considered an acceptable idea!_# Testability## What is testabilityIn its simplest form, testability is how easy a system is to test. This hides a lot of complexity but is a great starting point for a conversation. A testable system is one that enables a wide variety of testing types. From unit tests to exploratory testing. Plus other testing activities for specific needs such performance, security and accessibility.## Why is it importantTestability is a vital property of modern software. It enables software teams to make changes rapidly and safely. With clear feedback loops to understand the impact of changes. Developers need it to put in place change with confidence. Testers need it to assess risk and provide actionable information. With better testability product management can experiment with features for feedback.## How do you know if something is testable* You are in control of the amount of feedback your product gives you. Allowing either a deep, detailed view or a wide, shallow view. Rather than trying to parse what your product is doing, it will tell its story.* The product can be set into a state of your choosing, whether that be data or configuration. Allowing you to develop your product with much more certainty.* After release, you are not dreading the call from support that your customers are unhappy. Monitoring, alerting and metrics mean any problems are seen early and managed proactively.Watch - A Super Quick Guide to Testability by Nicola Lindgren <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPtlaOSuX88>Read - Untangling Testability by Rob Meaney <https://teatimewithtesters.com/untangling-testability/>Read - Testability and how to improve it by Alex Romanov <https://alexromanov.github.io/2022/08/14/what-is-testability/>Watch - Architecting for Testability by Emily Bache <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pybZziC7y2o>Act - 30 Days of Testability by Ash Winter and Rob Meaney <https://www.ministryoftesting.com/dojo/lessons/30-days-of-testability?s_id=13945699>

I have been waiting for the Typescript roadmap but it suddenly disappeared, was that a mistake or what ??
Hi :)How about adding `Nullability` to the `Schema`?Nullability plays an important role in schema design. 😄
Zustand should be included on the list as it is more preferable for State management than redux.
Create a section for Gitops. That or nest Gitops under Configuration Management. Which is basically using Git to manage your applications configuration in Kubernetes. - [ArgoCD](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) as one of the applications- [Flux 2](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2) as an alternative application
as the title, a complete roadmap for learn from basics to advanced algorithms and data structure.

I wanted to save the roadmap locally for now but when I clicked the download button it tells me to put my email ( which I did ), but it told me that I had already subscribed, which isn't what I was trying to do. Please is this a bug or is this the normal behaviour ?
Including AI, ML & NLP
I love and recommend this resource to everyone I know that is interested in IT. Can it be possible for an average timeline to crested for this path. Like 2 weeks for HTML, 2 weeks for CSS and so on? Thanks!
Hey there, I'm a software engineer working primarily with Dart/Flutter.I noticed some shortcomings of the Flutter roadmap, which concerns me due to the fact that it might impact the ability of a Flutter developer, and their chances of landing a job.The first shortcoming is the part about State Management. It currently lists 3 choices, which are GetX, VelocityX, and Redux. Professionally GetX is not looked very well upon. It frightens me that the 3 most widespread, well-documented, and best state management packages are NOT on the list. Of course I am biased as well, but VelocityX and Redux can never beat Provider, Riverpod Provider, nor BLoC. And although I don't want to debate this, GetX should, in my opinion, not even be on the list. You don't learn Flutter when using GetX, you learn GetX.Provider, if I remember correctly, is the package which is currently (officially) recommended by Flutter. Riverpod Provider is created by the same author.Another shortcoming I noticed, was the lack of explaining eg. InheritedWidget, and working with layout (MediaQuery, LayoutBuilder, Constraints) - See example https://docs.flutter.dev/development/ui/layout/constraints.Just my two cents, happy holidays.
Minor detail, but it bugs me. They aren’t called “functional” components (like the paradigm); they’re called “function” components (because they’re made from plain JavaScript functions). Admittedly most folks and blogs get the name wrong, but I like these roadmaps so I’m holding you to a higher standard than your average blog. :-) The official react docs have the right name. 
just a small change:Django is currently only listed under synchronous frameworks but it can use booth.If you using wsgi then you it is syncronous but you can also run it using asgi.(Django Async Docs)[https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/topics/async/]



For each topic you already added a 'TickMark' like that can you add how much average time to spend to each topics (based on your experience) . So in that way beginner like me will find it easy to plan the roadmap out. Otherwise sometimes it's overhwhelming when you look at the roadmap and don't know how to approach it.

Vue cli is not the best choice now. The official doc says that it's better to use Vite instead of vue cli.
Can we have an estimate of the time one can take to complete the most important aspects of the roadmap?
Short time ago the [new react docs](https://beta.reactjs.org/) was updated with all the information about the hooks and various utilities just talking about functional components, letting aside all about the class compononents, that makes the learning from docs way lesser confusing than learning from the older ones. I think is a good idea update the roadmap links with that ones.
Hey @kamranahmedse Awesome site!I have a suggetion to add stepik.org data structures course.URL: https://stepik.org/course/579/promo I have personally gone through it and is fantastic! It has very good basics of Data Structures and very nice exercises and is FREE! Please check it out.
I think if Cypress is there then Testcafe should also be included :)
I think test design and test design techniques should also be included (fx decision table testing, state transition testing and so one).source: http://istqbfoundation.wikidot.com/4

Hey there! I'm a Flutter Developer, and I'd like to make some suggestions for the Roadmap, which I really liked.In this part, Storage, I suggest the inclusion of Hasura, which is another type of backend/db, like Firebase, used by some devs. But in the job market, as far as I know, it's not used much. So it's just one more option.Also in Storage, something that is very much used by flutter devs, and that is very important to learn, are the Firebase Cloud Functions. Many APIs we use need to be consumed through them, so they are very important.Other Firebase features that are used a lot, but aren't really necessary to learn in the beginning, are Flutter Fire (for quick integration with Flutter) and Firebase Hosting.![Captura de tela de 2023-01-06 09-12-58](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51339096/211010838-8d578b50-d17a-4fca-8330-82dff8c6fab8.png)<br>In this part of Widgets, I suggest adding the InheritedWidget, as an option, which is the native base of many Widgets. Learning this helps to understand how some flutter widgets work.![Captura de tela de 2023-01-06 09-11-43](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51339096/211012777-8ad2d269-9cac-47d9-a4d4-e0d0497c53a7.png)<br>Here I strongly suggest adding a container for project architectures, to display the most used ones:MVC (very important)MVVMClean Architecture (important but advanced)![Captura de tela de 2023-01-06 09-10-44](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51339096/211013621-d30a80dc-e260-4fce-a9bb-f59dc160ff50.png)<br>In this section of State Management, I suggest uniting the two containers referring to BLoc, removing the importance of Velocity X and Get X (they are not very used) and adding the following managers:ValueNotifier and ChangeNotifier, which are native, so it's used a lot in some situations and is highly recommended. And they are reactive.MobX. It is a very used state management package, mainly together with Modular. It is reactive too and easy to use.I also recommend linking the Reactive Programming container with the State Management container, as one leads to the other. Many state managers are also reactive.![Captura de tela de 2023-01-06 09-09-15](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51339096/211013648-744f9a67-7333-4f74-9095-2d9f8608cf05.png)<br>Ah, I also suggest adding study sections for Flutter Web, Desktop, and Mobile.<br>And those are my suggestions. I hope it helps in some way.

This is a follow-up issue to #3182, which was marked as resolved 2 weeks ago.When clicking on "Download" on the Python roadmap, I get asked to enter my email.

Hey @kamranahmedse ! I love the roadmaps, but I'm finding a lot of references to Geeks for Geeks articles. I would suggest / recommend replacing them for at least two reasons: * They aren't a primary source and the accuracy of their content isn't validated. If there's no definitive source, then I would suggest linking to a Wikipedia article. It may not be 100% accurate, either, but at least it's open. * They plagiarize the work of others through blatant and brazen copy/pasta without giving credit where credit is due. Featuring them on roadmaps.sh creates backlinks that help them beat out better and more deserving sources in search. I would be more than happy to help find alternatives. Let me know! And keep up the good work!

Hello! I want to ask about Databases/SQL for DevOps. As I remember, DBs were an essential part of DevOps, but in your roadmap for 2023 there are no SQL and DBs
I am actually now focusing on learning hooks in react. While I definitely agree that we should have a basic hooks focus with useState and useEffect, I'd like to suggest that we bring up something like 'Complex Hooks' and bring in all the others. Each one of them then has their own set of articles for references instead of merging all of them into just one box.For example: I would think its very beneficial for people to look at useMemo a little bit more in-depth (perhaps what I mean is being more patient) and visit a couple of resources to understand what it means.What are your thoughts on this?

I wish you would bring back the 'Read', 'Watch', and 'Course' labels on your listings. It's nice to know what the link in pointing to.
I'd like to suggest adding Formkit (https://formkit.com/) or (https://github.com/formkit/formkit) under the Form section
Hello here,I've discovered the project and was happy to go through roadmaps, it's a great initiative I was about to contribute to, in the open source sprirt, as stated on the [website](https://roadmap.sh/) main page: > Open Source>> The project is **OpenSource**, [6th most starred project on GitHub](https://github.com/search?o=desc&q=stars%3A%3E100000&s=stars&type=Repositories) and is visited by hundreds of thousands of developers every month.Just before that, I went to look at the [project's license](https://github.com/kamranahmedse/developer-roadmap/blob/86a1a4a078eddf154872d1671013cd13eee61142/license) and I discovered it is not open source at all, for the source code according to the [definition given by OSI](https://opensource.org/osd) as well as for the knowledge/documentation in the spirit of the [Creative Commons](https://creativecommons.org/faq/#what-is-creative-commons-and-what-do-you-do).It looks to me it is untruthful to state this is an open source project where there are clear restrictions on how to reuse and redistribute the content collaboratively produced.The project would benefit a lot to clearly use an [OSI license](https://opensource.org/licenses) for the source code and [CC license](https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/) for the knowledge.There are several discussions[^1]  [^2] on this topic, none of them being answered at the time of writing.What is your opinion about that @kamranahmedse?[^1]: https://github.com/kamranahmedse/developer-roadmap/discussions/2942[^2]: https://github.com/kamranahmedse/developer-roadmap/discussions/2914
please make it easy to download the roadmap PDF, thank you
Add use webp image format as a good practice. Webp images are faster and lightweight than jpg or png.
I wanted to add dynamic programming resource the JavaScript developer roadmap
Hey there,Not an issue but just one on the colour side of things.1. Can there be an option to have light mode and dark mode between webpages?2. The button colour difference between https://roadmap.sh/roadmaps and https://roadmap.sh seems a bit weird on the roadmaps page. To me, seems a bit out of place compared to the home page

Hi, a colleague recently introduced me here.  It has been of great help.I would suggest this [link](https://linuxhandbook.com/create-systemd-services/) as part of systemd tutorial.Thanks.
in trees branch, the trees title is misspelled as tries
Hey, nice idea the roadmap. I would move the Version Control (git) box next to the Automated Testing though, they should be hand in hand. BDD as a concept and cucumber as a tool also part of the automated testing.Also a "modern" QA should have some knowledge of docker/Kubernetes and some cloud provider. 
Hello Community, Firstly, will like to thank you! all for the awesome Roadmap.Would be nice to have an added features with an input type of radio. Which can filter out based on the Expert level Topics (added the screenshot for reference: highlighted in yellow). Which can decluttered, with pleasant viewing and less intimating experience (information overload).Thank you for your time and consideration.![Screenshot for suggestion features](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/119530635/216024618-b792c012-66a4-4c8d-acf3-a106db7247e2.png)

Look forward to your reply
Testing Library has many implementations beyond just React. In its current naming, the section might be skipped by some developers who are using frameworks other than React.js.
Would like to see a data science roadmap. I can provide help.
Today's an AI era. we need a roadmap to create AI/ML apps.Can someone create roadmap for,1. AI2. ML3. openCV or similar specially to manipulate images and get image/video output
I suggest adding learning IDE either as a separate step or under language selection.With substeps:- [recommended] Keybindings- [recommended] Refactoring support- [recommended] Quick actions- [optional] Built-in templates
Hello there!What about [SPA](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application)? From my perspective, add some information about this technology would be highly recommended for newbies!More information may also be [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/SPA)

Great job! Looks absolutely awesome for some branches of CS but maybe it goes too deep into programming & dbs while completely overlooking many many branches such as logic and theory of computation, formal methods, UX (yes, it is a CS discipline in most comprehensive curricula), computer graphics, computer vision, virtual & augmented reality, digital signal processing, lambda-calculus & type theory, compilers, paradigms, robotics (which I know many graduations not to offer unfortunately) and others that I can't remember rn!
Just to share the information, seems like someone is blogging copy-pastes of your awesome work over at decipherzone.com blog. Not sure if there is much to be done about it and if it's covered by what licenses, but the graphics in the roadmap blog posts are quite clearly your graphs/roadmaps re-created as PDFs with their company watermark over it.- [Blockchain](https://www.decipherzone.com/blog-detail/blockchain-roadmap)- [DevOps](https://www.decipherzone.com/blog-detail/devops-roadmap)- ...Thanks for all you've done here. Roadmap.sh has been a great resource!
Suggest adding Podman as Container option.Also, add Pulsar/Kafka type Pub/Sub
I propose to add a development capability part for Automated Test.The following items would be great to be added:* JAVA* Python* Javascript* Docker* Shell Script
Shouldn't Data Structures come after Expressions and Operators? Maybe after Functions.
An account system so we can save our progress data across multiple devices.

Hi, I was triggered that the AWS cloud provider does not yet have a roadmap. Is it in program? Can I contribute? (for example with a sample of the roadmap?). Thank you very much, I love this project!
From [Typescript Roadmap](https://roadmap.sh/typescript) -> classes -> constructor overloading``` typescriptclass MyClass {  property1: number;  property2: string;  constructor(property1: number) {    this.property1 = property1;  }  constructor(property1: number, property2: string) {    this.property1 = property1;    this.property2 = property2;  }}```Got an error like this`TS2392: Multiple constructor implementations are not allowed.`
I'd like to learn game development and learning Com Sci to the start seems a pain in my back, please create a road map for game developing, I'll forever be grateful!!!
It would be nice to add these topics as more about APIs, similar to what we have for the database. They are pretty common cases when developing an API and play an important role.
Appreciate If we can add cloud engineering, developer and architect paths added to this with AWS, Azure, GCP tc.Appreciate your efforts.
Antd deserved to be listed in 'React > Styling' list for https://roadmap.sh/react:https://ant.design/
It will be great if you add widget and architecture components section in roadmap . Here are few in the list below **Widgets** - Recylerview - BottomNavigationBar- Viewpager - TabLayout-  ListView- Spinner - BottomSheetDialog **Component** - Viewmodels and Observers 
I found that an important topic is missing in NodeJS roadmap that is related to scheduled tasks/jobs. it is often required to schedule different tasks/jobs in NodeJS application. To fulfill this requirement there are different NodeJS implementations. some of these implementations are backed by redis and others are in memory.here is list of NodeJS modules for scheduling tasks/jobs:Bull - a job queue library that supports scheduling of delayed jobs and recurring jobs.https://www.npmjs.com/package/bullBullMQ - a Redis-backed message queue for Node.js that is based on the Bull job queue library and provides additional features such as priority queues and throttling. https://www.npmjs.com/package/bullmqKue - a Redis-based priority job queue for Node.js that supports job dependencies, delay and retry of failed jobs, and graceful shutdown.https://www.npmjs.com/package/kuehttps://automattic.github.io/kue/Bee-Queue - a Redis-backed job queue for Node.js that is designed for high-performance and supports features such as job progress tracking and timeoutshttps://www.npmjs.com/package/bee-queueBree - a  job scheduler for Node.js and JavaScript with cron, dates, ms, later, and human-friendly support.https://www.npmjs.com/package/breeRedisSMQ - a Redis-based simple message queue for Node.js that supports message prioritization and multiple consumer groups.https://www.npmjs.com/package/redis-smqNode Schedule - a flexible cron-like and repeating task scheduler for Node.js.https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-scheduleLater - a library that allows you to schedule jobs using a simple, human-readable syntax.https://www.npmjs.com/package/@breejs/laterNode-cron - a simple cron-like job scheduler for Node.js that allows you to schedule jobs using cron syntax.https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-cronNode-resque - a Redis-backed job queue library that supports scheduling of jobs.https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-resqueNest-schedule - a module for scheduling tasks in NestJS applications that uses Node Schedule under the hood.https://www.npmjs.com/package/nest-scheduleAgenda - a lightweight job scheduling library that allows you to define and schedule jobs to run at specific times or intervals. it has Mongo backed persistence layer.https://www.npmjs.com/package/agenda

Add the feature of **Mark as Completed** for users once they complete the task. This feature is there in most of the other pages but its not there in https://roadmap.sh/android
Quarkus is a relatively new java framework and should be present in the java roadmap under web frameworks.
FYI: This is my first suggestion so I don't know how helpful this is but here are just a few thoughtsHave you had any thoughts on adding Firestore as a NoSql? As you may already know, Firebase is a BaaS that offers two types of database services. Firestore is a document-based, NoSQL database. Here are some guides that I found very helpful. It is relatively short and only covers the bare basics but it's better than nothing.

I think one of the most important topic i.e., dynamic programming is missing from this roadmap. So, please add it.And I would like to contribute in this topic. So what is the way to contribute. Please explain the steps.
react-query, as it is based on promises, should not be only beneath REST subcategory of API's. It also supports GraphQL
 need a feature can attach own notes and resorsess (links, video links , files) to the roadmap
How about a Roadmap that In-depth explains Blazor in simple terms? 
Please, create a clear cut roadmap to becoming A HTML Email Developer.Thank you
Hello, great roadmap, thanks!  The only thing is react roadmap -> routers -> react router -> getting started guide is not accessible anymore. 
The link that talks about the history of Node.js is missing from the official website, I suggest changing it.![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/95165255/221313937-b94937ab-4bbd-454e-aeae-4588f1f81084.png) 
give me best backend recommendation
please make the **Dependency Injection**, **Design Patterns** and **SOLID Principles** so I can mark it as done. Thank you so muchFlutter Roadmap
I think it would be great to also add [Hexagonal architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexagonal_architecture_(software))to the list.
Hi,In order to improve process tracking, it would be great to provide an "in progress" feature -to indicate that the user is currently learning about that specific topic- besides "mark as done" and "mark as pending".
I don't think it makes sense to have PowerShell in the "Vim/Nano/PowerShell/Emacs" section. I think it should be separated out under "Learn Bash Scripting" as an Alternative Option. 
Language support can be provided. (Especially Turkish <3)
You don't have source control or artefact management. Everyone basically uses git now, but not everyone would use public hosted services like github / bitbucket.We also extensively use artifactory from jfrog for all our artifact management and is a key part of our developer  workflow.
Add standalone componentshttps://angular.io/guide/standalone-components
Some fundamentals of Flutter which are essential to at least know about when working with Flutter such as Keys, Inherited Widgets, Object oriented programming and few other topics. I would like to open a PR adding those required topics and fixing this issue. Can the project maintainers assign the issue to me?
A new roadmap suggestion. For things like communication, team-work, how to write good documents.
I would recommend [Script Setup](https://vuejs.org/api/sfc-script-setup.html) in Api Styles 
there is a typo in a word in the 3rd line of `migration`> Rather than make all changes at once, do smaller incremental changes to allow old code, and new code to **worth** with the database at the same time, before removing old code, and finally removing the parts of the database schema which is no longer used.the word _worth_ should be _work_
I also recommend these topics:- Built-in React Components- Built-in React APIs- React 18 hooks
### Suggestion: Allow to track progress by adding checkmarks to the roadmap This roadmap is very complete and a great tool and guide. However, I want to suggest adding a way to checkmark the different objectives or to download the roadmap as a checklist in order to allow the user to use the roadmaps as a way to track their progress. Cheers!
Hi, I'm Java developer suggestion the titles like:- Spring Reactivo o Webflux- Swagger- Spring batch- Spring kafha- Spring Websocket- Spring sheel link project with spring: https://spring.io/projects
Add Offsec certifications OSCP PEN-200OSWE WEB-300OSEP PEN-300https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/
Data is a very important part of the tech industry and I think it should be added to the roadmaps.
In the https://roadmap.sh/qa roadmap, add Testcafe.io as Automation framework

Thanks for your work!While reading the CS-Roadmap, I got confused with the Cache Algorithms. The MFU-Cache-Algorithm isn't defined by the removal of the "**least frequently used entry**".Instead, it is the "**most recently used entry**" (source: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_replacement_policies#Most_recently_used_(MRU))File: src/data/roadmaps/computer-science/content/104-common-algorithms/109-cache-algorithms/102-mfu-cache.md
Dev Tools have many implementations beyond just Chrome. In its current naming, the section might be skipped by some developers who are using browsers other than Chrome.[117-javascript-chrome-dev-tools](https://github.com/kamranahmedse/developer-roadmap/tree/8f8e2f41d838ea577e6e28e12ef4b5ccb1091e82/src/roadmaps/javascript/content/117-javascript-chrome-dev-tools)
The roadmap has a few blocks that mention some git tutorials but we don't have a block dedicated to Git and I think it is needed. Can we add a block before "Learn a programming language" dedicated to "Learn Git"?Some useful links: - Pro Git Book: https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2- Learn Git by Altassian https://www.atlassian.com/git- Learn Git Branching https://learngitbranching.js.org/- Learn Git & GitHub on Code Academy https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-git- Git Command Explorer https://gitexplorer.com/- Git Immersion https://gitimmersion.com/index.html- A Visual Git Reference http://marklodato.github.io/visual-git-guide/index-en.htmlIdea taken from milanm DevOps-Roadmap https://github.com/milanm/DevOps-Roadmap
list of exercises of each topic so people can practice and not stop in theory
Please add roadmap.sh to REST API.[Reason] In spite of GraphQL roadmap, roadmap.sh don't have REST API roadmap. Both are used in web development in public.Useful topics are followed:* [How to Use REST APIs – A Complete Beginner's Guide - freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-use-rest-api/)* [REST API Best Practices – REST Endpoint Design Examples - freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/rest-api-best-practices-rest-endpoint-design-examples/)* [10 Best Practices for Better RESTful API - Medium](https://medium.com/@mwaysolutions/10-best-practices-for-better-restful-api-cbe81b06f291)* [REST API tutorial](https://www.restapitutorial.com/)* [Top Resources for Learning and Designing REST APIs](https://www.crowdbotics.com/blog/top-resources-learn-and-design-rest-apis)* [What is a REST API?](https://www.ibm.com/topics/rest-apis)* [What is Rest API?

# package managers- `PyPi` is a repository, a package index, not a package manager- I would put `poetry` next to `pip` instead of `conda`
Hi there,I know it can be a bit difficult because of all the info, but since it has become such a big and well-known proyect... shouldn't it start being translated into other languages?1. Not everyone knows English, especially beginners.2. Despite knowing English, some people prefer to read in their native language.
please  also add blockchain road map 
Please add the prerequisite section in the roadmap of each topic (wherever it make sense ).E.g I visited Typescript roadmap , and there was no such thing mention . I think it is good to mention the prerequisites.

A creative developer is a developer highly skilled in software design (UI/UX Design, 2D/3D animations, etc). This is a particular branch of Front-end development that is poorly documented on the web. Having a Developer Roadmap could be very interesting. Example of Possible Roadmap: ```**Introduction to Creative Development**        What is Creative Development?

It would be nice to have a Data Engineer roadmap
Change link to new react docs, https://beta.reactjs.org/
Hello friends,At the era of inclusivity and at this year 2023, I found sad that accessibility isn't a mandatory point in this roadmap.Indeed, in Europe, the European Accessibility Act is adopted by most countries with the deadline of 2025.In the US and Canada, it's mandatory since some years ago now. This isn't an optional step, it becomes more and more important everywhere, and even mandatory in some countries if you want to be employable. That's not a personal opinion, that's purely factual. At Foyer, my current employer, we are even thinking of accepting only trained people in accessibility from now on. As a professional and recruiter, I really recommend this to be marked as important in the path proposed. Thank you 😊
Hello, I recently started using the skill-based roadmaps provided by this project and found them to be incredibly helpful for identifying areas where I need to improve and for guiding my learning of new skills. However, I think it would be even more useful if there were some boilerplates or sample projects available that could be used as a starting point for building out these skills.For example, if I'm following the roadmap for learning React, it would be great to have a pre-built React app or some sample code that I can use as a reference when building my own projects. This would not only help me get started more quickly, but it would also provide a concrete example of how to apply the skills I'm learning.I understand that everyone's learning journey is unique and that there is no one-size-fits-all solution, but having some boilerplates or sample projects available would be a great supplement to the existing roadmaps. It could also help to provide more context and motivation for learners who are just starting out.Overall, I think this would be a valuable addition to the project and could help make the skill-based roadmaps even more useful for learners of all levels. Thank you for considering my suggestion!
Hi, Great work. But seeing this excellent work, I would be greedy for a roadmap for something else, or something I am curious about. Just list out what you are focusing on, or something that cannot be done. Like embedded/systems programming or game development. Is this repository focusing only on web development? I cannot find such information clearly or may be I am bit dumber.

Add "Iris" to Golang web frameworks
1st of all amazing work ..2nd ..provide a full stack web dev roadmap
Just a note. Cassandra is not a column DB. See 2.1 in this doc https://www.baeldung.com/cassandra-column-family-data-modelIt's much closer to key-value store than a column db if you have to put a label on it. If you're allowed to create new subgroups, partitioned db, or even partitioned key-value db. Ideally Partitioned Row DB.Sorry. I'm messing up your system and I know the label won't fit. But .. a column DB it is not. 
hey the captcha in the website keeps opening after you solve it, its really annoying
pnpm should be the recommendation going forward.
It would be neat if it was possible to mark a roadmap as completed. I'm imaging this would be similar to marking a node within a roadmap as completed.
Hi!The road maps are difficult to read, so I want u to convert it into a mind map instead.A mind map that only shows child branches when clicked. For example, parent branch Architectural Patterns should hide Domain-Driven Design, SOA, CQRS, etc. I'm overwhelmed by jargons. I don't understand them. I wanna see the abstracted overview first. Not the subparts. I'd really love the roadmap if it was built this way. Thank you!

Hi! I would like to propose the creation of a `TVM-Based` blockchains group (like `EVM-Based` in the current version of [Blockchain Roadmap](https://roadmap.sh/blockchain)). Right now only one of the existing blockchain [TON (TONCOIN)](https://ton.org/) is represented in the roadmap. But we have a few more TVM-Based blockchains in our world: [Everscale](https://everscale.network/), [Venom](https://venom.foundation/) and [Gosh](https://gosh.sh/) – all of this use [`TON Virtual Machine`](https://ton-blockchain.github.io/docs/tvm.pdf) or are compatible with it.
Hi,Lately I have been reading a lot about metaverse and AI news, and both of this fields are in good time to study.I am also interested in knowing a good roadmap for them. Thank you,
Hi, the Android roadmap is a little bit outdated, there are things that should be already there like Background services and Broadcast recievers, and thing that are relatively new like Flow, Jetpack Compose, DataStore. Also, adding some architectural patterns like MVVM and MVI is a plus. Overall, I think the roadmap should be recreated. Thanks.
learnbyexample.org/python is good way to learn python, You can use as a resource. Thank you to effort
I would like to have the option to create an account and tick the thing I´ve learnt or at least export the roadmap in  a format that I can import in another tool, like notion.
Apologies If you find me being dumb. There is not state management in React Developer roadmap i.e like redux, redux-toolkit, zustand etc.

I follow and use your roadmaps and I want to thank you for the effort. It's nice documentation that helps a lot. I want to ask do you plan to create .NET MAUI roadmap.
- big data concepts- big data architecture- sync/async operations- streaming pipeline- distributed systems analys and monitoring 
Threads are one of the most important topic in java and i think i should be included in the roadmap also
Move Next.js into the first place instead of Remix.Many reasons for doing it. Two main are Next.js is the first option that is recommended by the React docs and Next.js has more jobs on the market so it makes more sense to learn it.
Want to add ebpf's learning roadmap!
**Hi Roadmap.sh!**I found a **problem** in your python roadmap...I don't want to say you have problem but **python roadmap** doesn't have **'For & While node'****Sorry** but please **edit this****Thanks for your good resource!!**
OOP should be learnt before datastructures because some of them need classes to be dealt with.That is my opinion as someone who is a beginner. 
Function as a Service for example LAMBDA AWS.FaaS, or Function-as-a-Service, is a cloud-computing service that allows customers to execute code in response to events, without managing the complex infrastructure typically associated with building and launching microservices applications.
Would love to see data engineering roadmap along with tools which are commonly used in the profession. Some great reference resources are : - https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp - https://medium.com/coriers/data-engineering-roadmap-for-2021-eac7898f0641 
Can you update Android Dev RoadMap, please sir?
I think there is no need to use one more link for the exact same example. The link that I want to remove "Creating Custom Hooks", redirects the user to the old react documentation which is already listed in this md file as "Reusing Logic with Custom Hooks".

First of all, thanks for this project! It’s a very useful reference for when people have career questions.As it stands, it seems that for someone to be able to deliver a complete product all on their own, that person needs to follow both frontend and backend roadmaps.**In other words, they have to become both frontend and backend developers.**However, in practice, I’ve seen these 2 main archetypes that lead to self-sufficiency (ability to ship a complete product on their own) that are not on the roadmap:- **Self-sufficient frontend developer.** They build apps mainly using modern frontend tech like React. When it comes to backend, they don’t need anything fancy, so they use Backend-as-a-Service offerings like Firebase or Supabase, and it does the job. When it comes to deployments, they use hosting providers like Netlify or Vercel.- **Self-sufficient backend developer.** They build apps mainly using modern backend tech like Go. When it comes to frontend, they don’t need a fancy UI, so they build simple front-end using Bootstrap, and it does the job. When it comes to deployments, they deploy it to an app platform like Railway or Hop.I think it would be very useful if there’s an optional path in the frontend/backend roadmaps that guides them towards self-sufficiency.

Some changes you might consider:* `nextTick` is not part of the Composition API. I'd consider not including `nextTick()` at all, as it seems no more important than several other topics that aren't mentioned.* Vue CLI has been replaced. `create-vue` is now used for scaffolding, which uses Vite. Vitest is a popular choice for unit testing.* I would remove Vuepress and Gridsome and add VitePress instead.* Vue Formulate was for Vue 2. It's now FormKit.* VueUse is a really important part of the Vue ecosystem.* The API Calls section seems a bit out of place. Several of the libraries listed there are orthogonal to using Vue. Some are very rarely used in practice.* If props are seen as fundamental then I think custom events and slots are too. Arguably component `v-model` deserves a separate mention too. I would probably have scoped slots listed separately, as an advanced topic. If the Fundamentals section feels a bit crowded, I think Attribute Inheritance could be moved down to Advanced.




The link to "[Consensus Mechanisms in Blockchain: A Beginner’s Guide](https://crypto.com/university/consensus-mechanisms-in-blockchain)" inside the CONSENSUS MECHANISMS  chapter within Blockchain Developer Roadmap is no longer available.
Blue node means that there is a separate roadmap for that node, as shown in the figure (backend roadmap): ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/122799969/229721011-84200359-0b45-45dc-8a97-49564c0441ec.png)This is achieved with `ext_link`: `{"controlName":"ext_link:roadmap.sh/best-practices/api-security"}`However, I found out that some of the new roadmaps don't integrate that way. For example, there is a roadmap for GraphQL and Kubernetes, but nodes are not using it (backend roadmap):![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/122799969/229721914-3c06bc5a-1725-4106-8e27-9d5b6742c834.png)So my proposal is to replace all such nodes with "blue" if possible.If you approve these changes I can try to do it, I have already done it for some nodes. It's worth noting that in this case references to existing resources will be removed, that is why I created the problem in the first place.
A roadmap to be a machine learning engineer will be very much appreciated
Been onboarding some devs on a Ruby on Rails stack and thought it'd be interesting to contribute to this awesome project with a RoR roadmap. Granted it's not the most exciting framework but it's still relevant. Here's the textual version of what this map could be.- Learn Ruby Basics  - What is Ruby?  - What is a Gem?  - Basic syntax- Introduction to Ruby on Rails  - What is Rails?  - History of Rails  - Rails principles    - MVC (Model-View-Controller)    - Do Not Repeat Yourself (DRY)    - Convention over Configuration (CoC)- Models  - Active Record Basics    - What is Active Record?    - CRUD  - Validations  - Migrations  - Associations  - Queries- Views  - Layouts & Rendering  - Forms- Controllers  - Action controller  - Routing- Asset Pipeline  - How to use  - Configuration  - Customization- Securing  - Sessions  - CSRF  - Files management  - User management  - Intranet & admin  - Injection  - HTTP Security- Debugging  - Debug  - Logger- Mailer  - Sending email  - Configuration- Testing  - Testing pyramid    - Unit tests    - Functional tests    - System tests  - RSpec- Caching  - Why use caching  - Cache stores  - Redis- API  - What is an API application?  - Why go MVC+?  - Building APIs  - Service Oriented Architecture (SOA)

It maybe a good idea to have account system where one would check items when they finish learning
I noticed that there haven't been any dedicated roadmaps for testing libraries, could it be added?

Thymeleaf should be there on Spring Boot Developer roadmap. 
Rightnow, We don't have **Spring Cloud LoadBalancer** or **Resilience4j** in the Spring Boot Roadmap. I think these are important components of Spring Cloud.  Another important topic is **Containerizing Microservices**hope, I create some value for the community.
I think, it is not good, when my learning roadmap progress is not stored after close tab
Add "Testify" and "Ginkgo" under "Testing your App".
Hie my name is Tadiwa, I was kindly requesting if you could add a roadmap for data science fields like analysts and machine learning engineering. It would be really appreciated. Just let me know what you think.
I want to follow the map and save my progress. I think a user account may be a good idea
Would love to see some kind of roadmap that fully covers AI w/ Machine Learning, Deep Learning, etc.
Maybe add GetX as an option for state management. Also why no deployment options for web/desktop development...

I'm writing to suggest adding "Elzero Mastering Python" Arabic to your Python resource. The course has received positive feedback and covers various Python topics, making it beneficial for your users who prefer learning in Arabic. The engaging teaching style and hands-on projects also make it a fun and rewarding way to learn Python.Thank you for considering my suggestion.https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDoPjvoNmBAyE_gei5d18qkfIe-Z8mocs
can add AI & machine Learning roadmap 
Suggestion for a feature change: Add a bookmark feature to tag/mark a box or topic. Bookmarks could be used to set half-point goals or keep track of a topic that you want to revisit/prioritize for later.
I'm not being able to download roadmaps. It seems like something was updated and i can't mark things as Completed when right-clicking a box
## You could also add a pathway to go into Data Science using Python* TensorFlow* Numpy* Pandas* SciPy* Matplotlib * SciKit-Learn
Hi KamranCan you please create roadmap for Full stack, Data science, Machine learning and Artificial intelligence 
Can we add the Rust language roadmap too?Rust online community is super helpful and I'm sure they would like to feature Rust in here, They will also give tons of suggestions on the proper steps for this roadmap.
"Wieframing" should be "Wireframing"![Wieframing](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/117166828/232441387-bfee31d2-c823-495d-8d78-6aa683024988.jpg)
I think you need to add something about loops to roadmap.
"Emails" should probably be "Email." The former sounds like its referring to individual emails, but the latter sounds like it's referring to the entire subject, which is probably the intent.Thanks for making this!
Can you add Hash Graph to the EVM Based please?

Replace PEV by PEV2
Hello,In Query Analysis you should talk about [PEV2](https://github.com/dalibo/pev2) instead of PEV. [PEV](https://github.com/dalibo/pev2#disclaimer) project seems to be abandonned.You should talk about [explain.dalibo.com](explain.dalibo.com) when talking about PEV2.Data partitionning and Sharding should not be on the same level. The first is basic and the other one is an advanced concept.In Log Analysis, you should also talk about [pgCluu](https://pgcluu.darold.net/) from Gilles Darold.In migration tools you should talk about [ora2pg](https://ora2pg.darold.net/) from Gilles Darold.Edit: You should also talk about [check_pgactivity](https://github.com/OPMDG/check_pgactivity), [temboard](https://labs.dalibo.com/temboard), [check_pgbackrest](https://github.com/pgstef/check_pgbackrest) in Monitoring.As for Develop Infrastructure skills you could talk about [pglift](https://gitlab.com/dalibo/pglift) and its ansible collection.You can also create a topic about anonymisation with [PostgreSQL anonymizer](https://labs.dalibo.com/postgresql_anonymizer)You should talk about terraform and not only docker.Robin,
Hello,We get Page not found! when trying to download Postgresql roadmaps.Robin,
I'm looking for information that expands on this particular point when consuming JWT on browsers.> Avoid ‘Basic Authentication’, use standard (e.g. JWT)What is the proper way to handle JWTs? Can I store them in localStorage? What is the best practice?How worried should I be with XSS if I were to store JWTs in localStorage?Maybe expand this for frontend consumption?---Here's my take.Have backend prepare 2 endpoints, one for login that accepts POST request with username and password and sets HttpOnly cookie on login success that will only be used on the second endpoint that generates JWT.All other APIs that serve application's resources shall use JWT for authentication.Frontend1. POST /api/login2. If 1 succeed, GET /api/token (cookie authentication)3. Store JWT in browser memory only (not storing in localStorage, sessionStorage, cookie or anywhere that maybe persistent)4. Whenever user comes back on new tab, do (2), if succeeded in getting JWT, continue, else show user the login screen and restart from (1)

Hello,I think it could be a good idea to sell poster of the roadmaps where you can scratch the tasks like scratch games.Or just poster, it would be awesome too.Robin,
For certain cards they are the same thing for example Javascript as a language is on multiple different roadmaps but when you click done on one roadmap it doesn't flow to another.What would be nice is for this to be implemented then there is less duplication across roadmaps and that when one card is updated (clicked done ) that is syncs across all roadmaps
To fully understand Kruskal's algorithm and all the topics related to the minimum spanning tree I think it is quite important to know the teory behind the [disjoint-set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disjoint-set_data_structure).The topic is already covered undirectly in other lessons but I think that a specific section with specific resourses related to the topic would be really useful.Thank you for your time and keep up with the great work. 🚀
Hello, Having gone through the roadmap for android Mobile application I think it would be nice to prepare a roadmap for Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile development.
in https://roadmap.sh/react -> rendering -> Ref -> [Learn useRef in 11 Minutes - Web Dev Simplified](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2ypzz6gJm0)This video is misleading bc the examples it gives are pretty misleading If you are a beginner.It shows more than one example that is only working bc useEffect is not rendering when `current` property of ref is changed.You can see this in the last example the author provide, when ref is used as a prev value, if for any reason, anything else triggers a render, this example will not work as expected and the `previous` value will show the actual value.
Mentioning the time taken to complete topics/ tasks/ milestones will motivate students further, and help them plan their studies.The average time taken to complete a topic can be calculated on the basis of recommended material.Others (from the community) can suggest directly how much time would they recommend to complete certain tasks/ topics.
Provide deep guide into API development(been inspired by that GraphQL roadmap). Now for:- REST- gRPC and tRPC 

Spelling mistake in "Understand the OSI Model"Second last paragraph. OCI should be OSI.
The license file seems like something that some already existing license could provide. Using such a license on this repository would set a great example for the novice programmers learning on this repository. Thoughts?

Hi, thanks so much for the roadmaps! I was wondering if there are any interactive websites offering responsive career paths for people in the tech industry... Would be a great help for students for example, thanks.
Hi there.The Roadmap is a great tool to know how to learn. also it could be very useful if it can be share profile there.The idea is to building a perfectional and technical resume that describes what topic they know and that are not learned yet.
More about databases and Scaling databases have the same content. 
In this project, we are using some gh actions & npm dependencies. We can add dependabot gh action to update gh actions & npm dependencies to the latest version if updates are needed.Dependabot will automatically create a PR. You need to just review it & merge it. I want to work on this issue.

My suggestion is to consider adding JOOQ and MyBatis. Those are pretty popular frameworks.also, tools like VisualVM/YourKitTools/Java Mission Control might be also worth adding.Additionally, various options for reactive java stack may be also good fit for the roadmap, e.g. [something from this github](https://github.com/politrons/reactive) 
I would suggest including web flux and reactive data usage.

These software engineers are typically responsible for building data pipelines to bring together information from different source systems.## referencies:- https://www.techtarget.com/searchdatamanagement/definition/data-engineer- https://github.com/adilkhash/Data-Engineering-HowTo- https://github.com/igorbarinov/awesome-data-engineering- https://medium.com/@darshilp/roadmap-for-data-engineering-2023-13f62f85d866- https://github.com/ErdemOzgen/Data-Engineering-Roadmap
please add Active Directory pen-testing to this roadmap because Ad is trending and important to get hired. i could like to contribute if you like.
Add [Memgraph](https://memgraph.com/) as a Graph DB suggestion. It's an awesome project with a very extensive documentation. I'm personally studying it right now instead of Neo4j.
There is a missing period https://roadmap.sh/backend > 'Interprocess Communication' > at the end of the sentence 'manage shared data'.
Can you please add a notes feature so that anyone can add notes for a particular topic when logged in.
It could be very useful to allow readers to highlight/mark some of the resources in a particular node. That would make it easy for us to figure out which resources were the most useful when visiting back.
Download button in the "Beginner Version" download the wrong form of the "Detailed Version" not as expected.Suggestion: * Download the page to pdf should be correlated to the page the user is viewing.![Screenshot 2023-04-27 145938](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49100236/234855450-5e63e130-8cd7-4653-86d5-50075b2dd854.png)

There is a small typo in sentence `Visi the following links for more resources` at [file](https://github.com/kamranahmedse/developer-roadmap/blob/e05269f1178350751d0e0a01911753929f9f86e4/src/data/roadmaps/system-design/content/105-availability-patterns/101-replication.md).
There is no section about constants in the Golang Developer roadmap.- https://www.w3schools.com/go/go_constants.php- https://gobyexample.com/constants- https://go.dev/ref/spec#Constants
On the Java Roadmap, I think it would be useful to include MockServer under Integration Testing or as a link under Mockito. It's very similar to REST Assured.Baeldung Post: https://www.baeldung.com/mockserverWebsite: https://www.mock-server.com/
When trying to access flutter internals > 3 trees or immutability, the info on the popup sidebar does not show and causes other items info to be inaccessible. 
Computer Science include fundamental computer science, and even a basic knowledge of theoretical computer science is big bonus. It would be interesting to add language theory, DFAs, context-free and Discrete clause grammar, as well propositional/first order logic (at least the basics). An introduction to markov chains for graph surfing as well would be relevant. Maybe also add dynamic programming and linear programming ? (as well as heuristics/meta-heuristics, genetic algorithms...)Maybe we could add fundamentals of programming paradigms (OO, functional, imperative, ...)I love your initiative and your work ! Thank you a lot for that ! (how about adding a math for CS or ML section ? I could help for that too if interested)

I would add a button to reset all boxes marked as done in a specific roadmapSomething like this:![resetmarkasdone](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91293101/235933027-d9fe4e05-f8e8-4ccd-adf2-c43ce2c6479b.png)
The link to download the android roadmap pdf is broken and says "Page not found".The link points to - https://roadmap.sh/pdfs/roadmaps/android.pdfRoadmap link - https://roadmap.sh/android
CEH is not an advanced cert.
It would be nice have this one.
Having an iOS/Swift Developer roadmap would be really helpful. Thanks!
Within Integration Testing, you should add Karate Framework. Since this framework is way more popular than Rest Assured even within the StackOverflow trends.For more information, you might want to check [Comparison with REST-assured](https://karatelabs.github.io/karate/#comparison-with-rest-assured)
Hi therefirst of all thanks for this commiunity especially backend developer roadmap. i want to ask you to add PHP developer (Laravel, Symfony and Phoenix framework) to roadmaps. thanks again and wish you best.
Create a beginner / simplified version of the Computer Science roadmap for people who just want to understand the most important basics / intermediate. The frontend roadmap has a beginner version, I suggest something like that.Thanks
Hey Kamran! So let me get straight to the point: When I was learning Front-end Development from <https://roadmap.sh/frontend> roadmap;I stumbled upon some broken links in <HTML> portion of this Roadmap....I've attached and marked the links which are broken in a SS attached to this req...![Screenshot 2023-05-08 013101](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81902744/236700456-916567c0-28cd-43ec-95e4-103537183c71.png)I'm just getting started with this roadmap and I'll make sure to suggest more changes if I find some more out there.....Thanks & RegardsBhavya
Hi! Thanks for making "https://roadmap.sh"Please make a checklist for each subset so that we know what parts have been studied.
- Page: <https://roadmap.sh/golang>- Section: `Learn the Basics`  - `Conditionals`  - `if, switch statements`These two nodes are named differently, but they actually point to the same topic: [Conditional Statements (107-conditionals.md)](https://github.com/kamranahmedse/developer-roadmap/blob/master/src/data/roadmaps/golang/content/100-go-basics/107-conditionals.md)
Authentication mechanism such as - PASETO - TOTP- Authentication based upon something we possess(mobile security code, email codes, SMS)- OAUTH
Hi!Your work on the repo is fantastic. Any plans for a game development roadmap? It would be immensely helpful for aspiring game developers like me.Thanks!
Why not mention Electron.NET?
I think you need to add a block about state management (redux/mobx)
could you create a full stack java developer roadmap that uses react as front end
Change the web frameworks to no longer include Gorilla as the project is no longer under maintenance - or add a note explaining such
Can you please change the color? 
Data is a very important part of the tech world so we should add a data science roadmap.
Should marking a task as done sync between different paths? For example if I mark something in frontend path as done and there is the exact same task in backend, should it be marked as done automatically as well? Can you consider implementing this? Thank you.
backend and devops links on to are linked to frontend page.
Add timeline for minimum time to learn these concepts and add more links to learn concepts
Spelling of Wireframing below the prototyping box
It's missing swift and kotlin/java integration using MethodChannel. This is a required and important knowledge that a lot devs ignore it because most of common features is already become a package.
Change Perimiter to Perimeter in the `Perimiter vs DMZ vs Segmentation` section. 
I think would be great to add suggestion of headless components like React Aria, Headless UI, Reach UI and others in the React Path.I discovered the world of headless components in this post:https://medium.com/@nirbenyair/headless-components-in-react-and-why-i-stopped-using-ui-libraries-a8208197c268
The roadmap is very amazing tbh. I just wanna suggest that there should be a way to like export it to like a checklist where a person can check the items he or she has learnt.
Add a progress bar to indicate "5 topics down, 23 to go"
I believe it would be helpful to include notes at each step to provide additional guidance and clarification.
When we set a language like java for example, the main class " Learn a Language" could be automatically set to "in progress" follow by the name of language selected.
In '**Update Status**', I like the little green dot that indicates '**Done**' or even the little mustard-yellow dot that indicates '**In Progress**'. What I don't like is the grey-coloured box that forms with a strike across the topic name after marking it, say, 'Done'. Why? Because that colour interferes with the grey coloured boxes of "_I wouldn't recommend_". Instead, I suggest you add the same little green dot along with the word 'Done' on a white-coloured card, then let that card rest on top of the topic name itself. When a user hovers their mouse on top of the box, hide the card and reveal the topic name. It would feel more natural to glance at any point and know what is done or is in progress. Similar indications for other options of 'Update Status' can also be given.Also, if, by any chance, there is a way to put in something like **footprints** or a colour-code on the path already traversed upon, it would be an immense visual treat!
Hello everyone, I believe there is an issue with this definition of *Throughput* that is presented on the roadmap:- Throughput $\longrightarrow$ Throughput refers to the number of requests a system can handle at the same time.Throughput doesn´t refer to the amount of requests *at the same time* but rather to the number of requests that a system can handle on a *unit* of time. Maybe im wrong, but I think requests don´t need to occur in parallel, as the definition presented in the roadmap implies.
This is just a few photos combined togather, It would be better if you make it as interactive as the others.
It will be very handy to have the ability to add comments/notes on each box, where we can note our custom resources to learn more! 
Please add https://www.coursera.org/learn/prompt-engineering in Prompt Engineering Roadmap (Resources)
It would be helpful if, upon marking one of the repeated boxes as done, all of them could be automatically updated in all roadmaps.
After choosing a node and scrolling down through its contents, two scroll bar knobs appear. Suggest showing an appropriate scroll bar depending on the current cursor focus.
https://learngitbranching.js.org/
Add the coding section as well. As, some of the cyber security role requires the coding knowledge. I believe most of the candidates struggle at this part. To figure out how and what to prepare for the coding section in security engineer role. Rest all is tremendously impressive  job. Well done (y). 
clicking on Performance optimisation section is opening Query operator section
Unlighthouse is an advanced npx package of Google Lighthouse which can be added to the 'Performance Tools' Section
[MongoDB roadmap](https://roadmap.sh/mongodb)Map tile **Query Operators** and **Performance Optimisation** open up the model with same content.https://github.com/kamranahmedse/developer-roadmap/assets/62259994/da499715-2f19-408e-802f-cfd330329132
I would like to suggest a new resource that I found pretty useful for the topic "How JVM Works?" (Getting Deeper).Include the following link:https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/jvm-tutorial-java-virtual-machine-architecture-explained-for-beginners/Title - "JVM Tutorial - Java Virtual Machine Architecture Explained for Beginners"
Hi there, I don't see any legend about the meaning of colored lines or boxes.Why are there different colours? Why are there plain lines and dotted ones?Regards,
I would like to add some new nodes to golang roadmap, as kratos framework https://github.com/go-kratos/kratos to microservices tools and pion webrtc https://github.com/pion/webrtc to realtime communication.
plz add DOM Manipulation in that

there should have been a button that reset all progress on a roadmap
For the `Testing your Apps` section, what about adding [vitest](https://github.com/vitest-dev/vitest)? I think it's worth it honestly.
### Student must know guide/roadmap to:**Algorithm Design and Optimization** and **Efficient Data Organization**.
One thing that would help a lot would be to make a version of the roadmap in other languages such as Portuguese PT-BR and Spanish.
Hi.  I would recommend adding this testing tools in VUE vitest and next to vue cli add VITE on which you also put a vue project very quickly
React Roadmap is full of links that are now out of date. The new React docs are at react.dev
# Add PWN CollegePWN College is the ASU curriculum to list of CTFs**URL:** https://pwn.college/## Aboutpwn.college is an education platform for students (and other interested parties) to learn about, and practice, core cybersecurity concepts in a hands-on fashion. In martial arts terms, it is designed to take a “white belt” in cybersecurity to becoming a “blue belt”, able to approach (simple) CTFs and wargames. The philosophy of pwn.college is “practice makes perfect”.pwn.college was created by [Zardus (Yan Shoshitaishvili)](https://yancomm.net/) and [kanak (Connor Nelson)](https://connornelson.com/) at Arizona State University. It powers ASU’s Computer Systems Security course, CSE466, and is now open, for free, to participation for interested people around the world!## Getting StartedAt the core of pwn.college is flags. How do you get those flags? Solve challenges. You can start a challenge by clicking on the Challenges tab at the top, selecting a module, clicking on a particular level, and hitting Start. In order to access that challenge, you have two options.The first option is using the Workspace tab. This will present you with a fully functional development environment in your browser via Visual Studio Code. You can, for instance, quickly open a new terminal by pressing F1, searching for New Terminal, and pressing enter.The second option is using ssh. In order to ssh into your challenge instances, you must add a public ssh key to Settings > SSH Key. You can quickly generate an ssh key by running ssh-keygen -f key -N '' in a terminal on your (unix-friendly) host machine. This will generate files key and key.pub, which are your private and public keys respectively. Once you have linked your ssh key to your account, you can run ssh -i key hacker@dojo.pwn.college to connect into your challenge instance.Once you are in a challenge instance, your goal is to get the contents of the /flag file. Unfortunately for you, you are executing as the hacker user, but /flag is only readable by the root user. Fortunately, however, there are challenge programs located inside of the /challenge directory, which when run, will run with the privileges of the root user. Solve the challenge to get the /flag, and then submit it in order to complete the challenge!A few things to note. Your home directory /home/hacker is persistent. This means that when you start a new challenge, all of the files you have saved in there will still be there. The Practice button can be incredibly useful for debugging your solution. When you start a challenge in this way, you will have the ability to run programs as the root user with the sudo command; however, the instance will only have a practice flag. For some of the later (kernel-focused) challenges, you will need to solve the challenge in a virtual machine. You can interact with the virtual machine using the vm command.
Just a note, computer science roadmap says Tries instead of Trees.<img width="338" alt="image" src="https://github.com/kamranahmedse/developer-roadmap/assets/8909476/b469acba-a920-46e6-b79b-5299187b89eb">middle of page: https://roadmap.sh/computer-science
Certifications are incorrectly categorized.- CompTIA A+ and CompTIA Network+ help in getting started with networking but they are not security certifications.- CompTIA Security+, GSEC, GPEN are beginner level certifications.- GWAPT, CEH and OSCP are also considered beginner level but they are not easy. CEH has a requirement of authorized training or 2 years of experience.- CISSP, CISA, and CISM are advanced certifications and have a requirement of 5 years of experience but they are also inclined towards management and leadership rather than technical expertise.- GIAC is not a certificate in itself but the organization that gives GPEN, GWAPT etc.
- Remove the "using namespace std" directives from the code snippets;- Add range-based for loop, which simplifies iterating over elements;```c++for (int number : numbers) {    // do something;}```- Add locale header "simple use" explanation (setting the terminal/console to show characters in the people native language) with the function setlocale;- Add [cppreference](https://en.cppreference.com/w/) on the References / Additional Resources area.;- Arithmetic operators are duplicated: one in 102-basic-operations & one in 103-functions;- Include/header guards should be explained earlier.```cpp#ifndef MY_HEADER_FILE.H#define MY_HEADER_FILE.H// my header file content;#endif```
- Add [OWASP Web Security Testing Guide](https://owasp.org/www-project-web-security-testing-guide/) node.
Add:Input / OutputControl flow - if/else/switch





I believe creating a roadmap for game development would be a valuable addition, as there are people who feel overwhelmed when starting out in this field.

The present issue entails the failure of all child tiles within the **scaling** MongoDB to render properly, as they consistently encounter a `404` error. Conversely, the main **scaling MongoDB** tile remains unaffected, successfully retrieving data and receiving a `200` response. Nonetheless, after encountering a `404` error, the data fails to render in **any** of the tiles containing information.https://github.com/kamranahmedse/developer-roadmap/assets/62259994/73b42dd5-e8e6-4fb9-ab26-ff908b31a85b
The Prompt engineering roadmap is incomplete when considering all the possible usages for LLM with tools like Langchain and the alternatives to simple Text/Chat completion. There are also essential concepts about IA to cover that are currently game changers and friendly for non-ML engineers to know like embeddings, similarity, and basic IA tasks(e.g. classification).I don't even think prompt engineering is a good idea for a roadmap, it fits much more like a topic for a roadmap. I suggest changing to something like LLM Engineering.
Please change the color for either the concept items or tool items.Doing so would improve the visual identifier, as the colors are currently too similar. It definitely would help my learning process and I think it would help others as well.
Hi. Thank you guys for the roadmap it is helping me a lot!I have a suggestion of adding the topic Meta Transactions or Gassless Transactions to the General Blockchain Knowledge resource. What do you guys think?

The same topics that I marked on the frontend are also available in the backend or in different areas, but they are not marked.Users who want to move to another field can make easier choices.
Fix "Programming _Lanugages_" in web development prerequisites
When we download the PDF, can you make the topics as clickable links as in the website. It could really help people not to require to visit website and search it manually in order to follow the topic links even if they have the roadmap PDF downloaded with them.PS: If there could be any redirection to particular topic to the website, that could serve the purpose as well.

I started the DevOps Roadmap a couple of weeks ago. Today I tried to continue with it and... Surprise! The topics about SO basic concepts have gone. Although the new roadmap is better focused on day-by-day work, I was enjoying that emphasis on building a foundation before that.It could be great if you add navigation between the different versions of the same roadmap so one can finish the current studying section at least.
Here is what I would suggest adding ![ml-engineer](https://github.com/kamranahmedse/developer-roadmap/assets/101447544/6181aaea-79ba-4a9e-aff6-9ab3e6be0dc1)

It will be beneficial for people wanting to deep dive into the heart of the Linux operating system. Here is a textual roadmap for this:Linux Kernel Developer Roadmap1. **Introduction to Linux and the Kernel**        - What is Linux?    - What is the Linux Kernel?    - Role and responsibilities of the Linux Kernel    - Different Linux Distributions2. **Understanding Operating Systems**        - Basic components of an Operating System    - Processes, threads and scheduling    - Memory management    - File systems    - Interprocess communication    - Device Drivers3. **Learn Rust Programming Language**        - Basics of Rust    - Rust memory management    - Concurrency in Rust    - Rust crates    - Writing efficient Rust code4. **Using Linux**        - Installing Linux    - Basic Linux commands    - File system hierarchy    - Package management    - Users and permissions5. **Linux Internals**        - System programming    - System calls    - Signals    - Memory mapping6. **Understanding the Linux Kernel**        - Architecture of the Linux Kernel    - Process management in Linux    - Linux Memory management    - Linux I/O system    - File systems in Linux    - Linux Network subsystem    - Linux Device Drivers7. **Setting up a Kernel Development Environment**        - Installing necessary tools    - Configuring a development environment    - Downloading and building the Linux Kernel8. **First Contributions**        - Finding good first issues    - Understanding the Linux Kernel community and mailing list    - Coding style and conventions    - Submitting patches9. **Advanced Linux Kernel Development**        - Debugging the kernel    - Kernel modules development    - Developing device drivers    - Kernel and hardware interaction    - Networking in the kernel10. **Linux Kernel Development with Rust**        - Understanding the Rust in Linux project    - Writing kernel modules in Rust    - Developing device drivers in Rust    - Submitting patches written in Rust11. **Contributing to Linux**        - Networking with the community    - Reviewing and testing patches    - Becoming a Linux maintainer12. **Linux Kernel Security**        - Understanding security vulnerabilities    - Secure coding practices    - Kernel hardeningNote: Given the vastness of this field, the roadmap outlined above provides a guideline to approach it and is not exhaustive but hopefully with the contributions of others who are actively working on the kernel development and mentors the list should become a reliant roadmap for anyone who aspire to be a Linux Kernel Developer.
In the "running your first program" section, we currently have the following:- [x] Write the first hello world program.- [x] Explanation of the first program What we don't have- [ ] Creating and saving the file (i.e. making a file with the `.cpp` extension)- [ ] Running that file  (for all the different OS)
What about VNC protocol in addition to RDP? I realize they're not apples to apples, but with RDP as a proprietary tool and VNC more platform agnostic, it may be a worthwhile addition!

Accessibility should 100% be a more strict one to learn, after all it is a legal requirement in development even if people don't do it.
In the Routers > React Router section of the React Developer roadmap, the 'Getting Started Guide' link leads to a 404-page on the React Router website. I believe the correct landing page should be [this](https://reactrouter.com/en/6.13.0/start/tutorial) instead.

Under 'Decentralization', the second article, "What Is Decentralization in Blockchain? (Blockchain Council), is essentially the same as the first article on AWS. It honestly looks like they took the article and just changed certain words/terms, like you would in school, to avoid plagiarizing. Diction choices were poor and made it more convoluted as opposed to reiterating the same content in a way that would help retain it. I don't think it's worth keeping.Also, thank you for this resource.
Hi, when I see the roadmap on `Type Checkers`, I found there is only Typescript. On the other hand, there are some unpopular alternative, such as [`Flow`](https://flow.org/) (from Facebook), [`ReScript`](https://rescript-lang.org/), or maybe [`JsDoc`](https://jsdoc.app/) ?. I am curious, what do you think about those alternatives?![image](https://github.com/kamranahmedse/developer-roadmap/assets/37765885/62c678f7-1caa-4bcb-a569-abfe92fd2232)

I think just putting "learn a language" alone is not enough.Why don't you put more topics under "learn a language" for example, to learn the basics of DSA (data structures and algorithms) or Django web framework, even tho there is a Python Developer road map that covers all python related topic, I wish that you make it in order and more specified for the back-end map.Please respond as quickly as possible, because I don't know in where should I start first, frameworks or databases or API's, I think there are some confused people like me also.
Just a nice-to-have, but if there are options to learn (i.e. `Node.js` here), it would be cool if users could select different replacement languages from the dropdown, such as Go or Python.This would let me check Go's resources that you've gathered right from this view.<img width="974" alt="Screenshot 2023-06-23 at 7 07 28 AM" src="https://github.com/kamranahmedse/developer-roadmap/assets/43115008/7b24673c-891c-4dfb-8d68-9c0bba1d26d0"><img width="620" alt="Screenshot 2023-06-23 at 7 07 53 AM" src="https://github.com/kamranahmedse/developer-roadmap/assets/43115008/ccf857f8-f02c-4d39-927b-59e8e7d32e83">
# Description:I have come across a typo in the "Package Managers" section of the road map website. Specifically, under the heading for **C++ Archive Network (cppan)**, there is an issue with the formatting of the heading. I would like to rectify this issue by providing the necessary corrections in the Markdown format.
# DescriptionI have discovered a typo error in the heading of the "First C++ Program" section. Specifically, there is an error in the `main()` function heading. I would like to address this issue by proposing a fix to ensure accuracy and clarity.
### Description:I have identified a typo error in the "namespace" section of the code/documentation. Specifically, there is an incorrect usage of the "using" keyword. I would like to rectify this issue by proposing a fix to ensure the correct usage of the "using" keyword within the namespace section.

Hi there,Just a thought to share with you as a suggestion i have in roadmaps design page.  in some of the roadmaps, there is a legend in the left side top for the suggestions like topics order to be learn (beginner, intermediate. etc), recommendations legend, etc. This order, recommendations are helpful to start learning topics. If you provide a clickable option on these to show only selected legend options that would be nice to filter the topics. if we take "Frontend Developer" and if i click "Personal Recommendation / Opinion" which has purple tick box, then the below shown topics are filtered with the topics for that (purple tick boxes) others will be hidden. This will help to see the selected legend's topics alone and we can further explore the topics. once all the topics are covered then i will click for "Alternative option" and so on. Hope this makes sense to tryout and see how it is coming. Thanks!
Load, Stress are part of Performance testing not separate types of testing
For example, add `tabindex` to the elements of `g.clickable-group` (but arrange the elements in a logical order or assign them the appropriate `tabindex` value)

GZIP / Brotli compression is enabled. I would tweak the wording of this, where it says "Use a compression method such as Gzip or Brotli to reduce the size of your JavaScript files." I would suggest that it should be, enable compression methods such as Gzip and Brotli to to reduce the size of your requests (such as JavaScript, CSS and HTML). Favour Brotli over GZip where possible due to performance benefits of 14% smaller JavaScript files, 21% smaller HTML files and 17% smaller CSS files over Gzip. Also if using a CDN such as Cloudflare/Akami make sure that the CDN is setup to enable Brotli compression.
The card "Buffer" on the Go roadmap has a link called "Buffers in Golang" that points to [this](https://youtu.be/NoDRq6Twkts) video. The video is about protocol buffers and there's a specific card about protocol buffers later on in the roadmap. The resource should be moved to the "Protocol Buffers" card.
It would be really nice if there was a theme toggler to switch between Dark and light theme.I would like to work on this feature. @kamranahmedse 
Hello,First I would like to thank you for taking the time to build this valuable content. I propose that you could make a small change in the order of the main topics to place the network, security and protocols topics, followed by the VCS Hosting topic, keeping in mind that to properly understand the concepts of web servers, firewalls, load balancing, containers and cloud services, it is important to understand the networking and protocols concepts. Thanks for sharing with the community.Have a nice day.

### Roadmap URLhttps://roadmap.sh/qa### SuggestionsHi,the roadmap is great but only follows "execution" roles. A QA engineer, manual or automation, can easily grow towards test management/defect management/release management and these are useful skills to add.Please look into that, or feel free to reach out to me if you need more specific contributions. The roadmap as-is now would cover maybe 3-4 years of career progression in manual, with quite a lot more in automation simply because the tech keeps evolving and you need to learn it, not because you get to do anything dramatically different.So, as far as QA goes, we still lack vision over how a length career can look like and this puts off many people who do not want to be in execution jobs for decades. I am one of them.
### Roadmap URLhttps://roadmap.sh/computer-science### SuggestionsI believe JS should be among the "Pick a Language" Section.
### Roadmap URLhttps://roadmap.sh/system-design### SuggestionsThe Consistency Patterns topic mentions 3 patterns but makes no attempt to even summarize them before the external link.The 3 separate pages then do a poor job of defining the patterns too, relative to the link (same on all 4 pages), which is copied verbatim on Consistency Patterns.I see two options:1. Convert Consistency Patterns into a page like CAP above it where the subpages are really just one page when clicked. (preferred)2. Update Consistency Patterns with some info on the three, ie:"Strong consistency - synchronous update everywhereWeak consistency - synchronous locally (ie multiplayer game) but asynchronous globallyEventual Consistency - asynchronous and indeterminate"2a. Ideally improve the subpages too if they remain.

### Roadmap URLhttps://roadmap.sh/react-native### SuggestionsI would propose adding a section about CI/CD automation specific to React Native. Even though there is already a "DevOps" roadmap, it is still relevant to refer to some build automation, production deployment, and testing tools that integrate well with React Native. It can also be a merger with the "Publishing App" section.The tools in question are:- Bitrise- AppCenter- Appcircle- BuddyThese tools are platforms that are oriented towards mobile development and provide better advantages compared to traditional CI/CD tools like Bitbucket, Travis-CI, CircleCI, etc.If you have any suggestions on this topic, I would be happy to hear them!

### Roadmap URLhttps://roadmap.sh/system-design### SuggestionsI am not sure wear a good resource to link would be, but here are some descriptions and examples from ChatGPT:1. Cache-Aside:In cache-aside caching, the application is responsible for managing the cache directly. When data is requested, the application checks the cache first. If the data is found in the cache, it is returned. If not, the application retrieves the data from the underlying data source, adds it to the cache, and then returns it to the requester.Imagine you have a bookshelf where you keep your favorite books. Whenever you want to read a book, you first check your bookshelf. If the book is already there, you pick it up and start reading. If it's not on the bookshelf, you go to the bookstore, buy the book, bring it home, and add it to your bookshelf before you start reading it.2. Write-Through:In write-through caching, when data is updated or written to the cache, it is also immediately written to the underlying data store or database. This ensures that both the cache and the data store are always in sync.Imagine you have a personal diary where you record your daily activities. Whenever you do something noteworthy, you write it down in your diary and also immediately tell your best friend about it. This way, your diary and your friend always have the same information.3. Write-Behind:In write-behind caching, data updates are initially written to the cache without immediately updating the underlying data store. The updates are eventually propagated to the data store in the background or when certain conditions are met, such as a batch write or a specific time interval.Suppose you have a shopping list that you keep adding items to as you run out of them. Instead of going to the grocery store immediately after adding each item to the list, you wait until the end of the week and then go to the store with your complete list, making one big purchase.4. Refresh-Ahead:Refresh-ahead caching, also known as prefetching, involves proactively fetching data from the underlying data source and updating the cache before it is explicitly requested. This anticipates future access to the data and reduces the latency of retrieving it when it is actually needed.Imagine you are hosting a party, and you know that your guests will likely ask for drinks throughout the evening. Instead of waiting for them to ask for each drink individually, you proactively prepare a tray of assorted drinks and keep it nearby, ready to serve. This way, the drinks are already available, and your guests don't have to wait for each drink to be prepared individually.

### Roadmap URLhttps://roadmap.sh/javascript### SuggestionsAdding promises to the JavaScript roadmap is a valuable step to further enhance the language's capabilities and promote better asynchronous programming. Promises provide a more structured and reliable way to handle asynchronous operations, making code easier to read, maintain, and debug. By including promises in the roadmap, JavaScript developers can take advantage of a standardized approach to handling asynchronous tasks, leading to more robust and scalable applications. Additionally, integrating promises will pave the way for adopting modern JavaScript features and libraries, ensuring that the language remains relevant and adaptable to the ever-evolving web development landscape.To get started with pro mises, developers can refer to the official Mozilla Developer Network (MDN) documentation on JavaScript promises, available at [.](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise) This comprehensive resource provides in-depth explanations, examples, and best practices, allowing developers to master the usage and implementation of promises in their JavaScript projects efficiently.

### Roadmap URLhttps://roadmap.sh/frontend### SuggestionsThe website is amazing, but I think this suggestion would make it more intuitive for people who are new to the site. I understand the checkmark icons are there to specify the level of recommendation, but I don't think that adds a lot to the roadmap. For a new user, like me, we don't know who is recommending or not the lesson. If the creator of the site (who the new user assumes is the one posting the lessons) is not recommending the lesson, then why have it there? The icon of a checkmark most of the time implies something is done, especially when the checkmark or the checkmark container is green. The color of the box should change according to the color of the status we select inside the lesson where the links are. Changing, the lesson to "in progress", which has a yellow-ish icon turns the box to the color purple, and changing it to "done", which is green, changes it to another shade of the previous yellowish color but with a strike line. I think what I am trying to say is that there should be more consistency with the use of colors. If the level of recommendation icons were to stay, I would suggest removing the checkmark and leaving only the circle, while using a color scheme different from the colors used in the boxes and the colors used in the status options.

I have taken the first of these exams and I know that they are well-regarded in the industry. They give a hands-on approach to examinations as they are dynamic labs (as opposed to just theory-based) which provides a better view of someone's abilities. The current ones are a lot more focused on more general IT. Additionally, you could have different certification sections depending on the skillset people are going for. Here's a good site that show's a bunch of certifications and what category they fall under [security-certification-roadmap](https://pauljerimy.com/security-certification-roadmap/).

Hint you can use [cheerio](https://github.com/cheeriojs/cheerio)"When I checked it, it appears that the **_cheerio module is not fully built yet_** so the main function to do the above task ( cheerio.fromURL() ) is not out yet.

### Roadmap URLhttps://roadmap.sh/python### SuggestionsI suggest to include a node about Python dependency management and the ecosystem around it. Since this is a broad topic with a lot of different approaches and tools this could confuse a new Python developer. An explanation of how dependencies have been managed historically (`requirements.txt`) and what is the modern solution (`pyproject.toml`) could provide some guidance.I realize that this is somewhat related to Python package managers, but perhaps deserves an own node.

### SuggestionsHello, I would like to propose an enhancement for roadmap.sh regarding the display of steps on the roadmap. Currently, when I skip a step, it simply becomes a darker color, and this is no comfortable. My idea is to automatically remove the skipped steps from the roadmap instead of just changing their colors. Additionally, I suggest adding a separate page or button at the top of the navigation bar where all the skipped steps would be stored. This would allow me to easily review and add these steps to the roadmap if I change my plans regarding them. I believe that this change will add more convenience and clarity to the usage of roadmap.sh. Thank you for considering my proposal.

### Roadmap URLhttps://roadmap.sh/cpp### SuggestionsIn the data types section, you suggested that the difference between structs and classes is that classes can have member functions and access specifiers. I believe this is not true. The only difference between them is the default access specifier: for structs, it is public; for classes, it is private.
### Roadmap URLhttps://roadmap.sh/aspnet-core### SuggestionsAs mentioned in the heading can i request an option for having the recommendation ticks and the other stuff be turned off and on like through maybe a checkbox or something else entirely as when i first look in the roadmap at a first glance it looks overwhelming so I think it would be great if we had an option to activate or deactivate recommendations and other stuff as so it gives the user more confidence in the following through their respective topic in the roadmap. i like for every topic you view you can choose whether if you have that topic, working on that topic or have yet to the topic I think as well as crossing completed topics I think it would be great if we have colour coded options as well as corssing topics as it gives an better indication at a glance of what topics you have done and what topics you have yet to do.

### Roadmap URLhttps://roadmap.sh/golang### SuggestionsFor the Logging node, I think that [Slog](https://pkg.go.dev/log/slog) should be added as a sub-node. It was previously an experimental package, but [Go 1.21](https://go.dev/blog/go1.21) (now released) officially brought it into the standard library. This makes it the new standard for structured logging, and I think it would be helpful to teach those trying to learn Go to use packages from the standard library until they find a good reason not to.I have found the following resources helpful in learning Slog, however I'm sure more will come out soon now that it is in the standard library:- [Developer Cafe](https://thedevelopercafe.com/articles/logging-in-go-with-slog-a7bb489755c2)- [Better Stack](https://betterstack.com/community/guides/logging/logging-in-go/)Thanks for your great work!

### Roadmap URLhttps://roadmap.sh/ai-data-scientist### SuggestionsHello, I'm a student, and I greatly appreciate your AI and Data Science roadmap. I have a question regarding the necessity of R language in a data scientist's toolkit, as well as the relevance of databases such as AzureML or Hadoop in this field. I'm curious about why they haven't been included in the roadmap. Are these tools no longer considered relevant in the field of AI and Data Science?

### Roadmap URLhttps://roadmap.sh/ai-data-scientist### SuggestionsI hope this message finds you well. First and foremost, I want to extend my heartfelt appreciation to the entire team for crafting such an outstanding roadmap. Your dedication and hard work are truly commendable, and it's evident that a lot of thought and effort has gone into creating this valuable resource.I strongly recommend the inclusion of a dedicated section on visualization tools. In the rapidly evolving field of data science, the ability to effectively communicate insights and findings through visualizations is becoming increasingly important. To this end, **I propose incorporating visualization tools such as Power BI, Google Tableau, and Plotly into the roadmap.**Thank you for considering my suggestion. I look forward to seeing the roadmap continue to evolve and empower individuals on their journey in the field of data science.Warm regards,Adam Elhefnawy.

### Proposed feature: Download roadmap as a single filehttps://roadmap.sh/### SuggestionsDear roadmap.sh team,I am writing to suggest a change to your website. I believe that it would be beneficial to add a feature that allows users to download the entire roadmap, including all of its subpages. This would be a valuable tool for users who want to keep a copy of the roadmap for reference or who want to share it with others.I understand that you currently allow users to download individual roadmap pages. However, this can be time-consuming if a user wants to download the entire roadmap. Additionally, it is not possible to download all of the subpages of a roadmap page with the current functionality.I believe that adding a feature to download the entire roadmap would be a relatively simple change to make. It would also be a valuable addition to your website, as it would make it easier for users to access and share the roadmap.Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to hearing from you soon.Sincerely,Athar Imran

### Roadmap URLhttps://roadmap.sh/frontend### SuggestionsIt would be amazing if a user could hide sections from the road map, in order to create a sub-roadmap that could be shared with other users. A use case would be a mentor teaching a younger developer some things, and wanting only a couple stops on the roadmap to present to the person learning.Maybe for some reason I want to hide the authentication and web components sections, to keep the map simple. Or I want to share only a section, so I hide everything except for the build tools and testing sections. Users could hit a button to restore the full roadmap. The sub-roadmap could be shared with a link that would hide the same sections as the original.

It would be quite my personal recommendation for those who work with Azure.
### Roadmap URLhttps://roadmap.sh/blockchain### SuggestionsIn the current version of the blockchain, the **Move programming language** is not included. Recently, Move programming language has gained popularity in the market due to its significant utility in blockchain development. Prominent chains like Aptos and Sui are among the most popular platforms that have adopted the Move programming language.Some useful documentation links:Move Language in formations written by MystenLab/Sui | https://github.com/MystenLabs/awesome-move-- | --Move Book (single source of knowledge about Move language) | https://move-book.com/Move Language Uses | https://move-language.github.io/move/
### Feature DescriptionIt would be nice to be able to add your own links to a roadmap that just show up for you.For instance, I'd like to add some interesting articles to the Promises section of the JavaScript roadmap without having them show up for anyone else so I can add and work through stuff I find on my own.  These would only show up as additional links for my account (though, when adding, perhaps a checkbox to request the link be submitted as an addition to the official roadmap).Additionally, it would be nice if in my account dashboard, I could see a list of all links that I've added to my roadmaps with the ability to filter them by roadmap or roadmap topic.
### Feature DescriptionIt would be really cool to add a game hacking roadmap which gives a lot of resources and explains all kinds of cheats and reverse engineering (maybe a separate roadmap which is connected to game hacking). There is like the classical internal and external cheats, but also the more exotic ones, for example where you rebuild your own "modified version" of the game, e.g: Minecraft clients. Also would be cool to include how kernel drivers work/anticheats and the concepts of bypassing them, bypassing DSE, etc. I am requesting this, because I am in no way eligible to provide any resources because I am still learning myself and that's why I am asking for this :D
### Feature DescriptionA dark mode to the website will help our eyes to have less strain.

### Roadmap URLhttps://roadmap.sh/software-architect### SuggestionsThe Rust language is ever evolving and gaining more developers and users over the last years. It would be nice to have it next to Java, Go and the other programming languages on the roadmap. Especially in context of embedded and reliable software development, this language is (currently) outstanding.Next to a description and further links a brief description of the general Rust concepts would be helpful.- [Main Website](https://www.rust-lang.org/)- [The standard library](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/index.html) Comprehensive guide to the Rust standard library APIs.- [Edition Guide](https://doc.rust-lang.org/edition-guide/index.html) Guide to the Rust editions.- [Rust by Example](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/) collection of runnable examples that illustrate various Rust concepts- [Rust Playground](https://play.rust-lang.org/) to test your knowledge Definition of Ready:- evaluate what to tell about rust in the roadmap- define details of the definition of doneDefinition of Done:- short description of Rust programming language - general Rust concepts (borrowing/mutating values, crates, std lib)- further links to dive deeper (like those above)- add Rust to architect roadmap -> programming languages
### Roadmap URLhttps://roadmap.sh/java### SuggestionsSwitch "Data Structures" and "OOP, Interfaces, Classes" because for people o dont know, doest make sense learn diferent ways to store data when you dont know what is a class or a interface.

### Roadmap URLhttps://roadmap.sh/react### SuggestionsReact.dev no longer recommends using the create-react-app CLI in its "Getting Started" [documentation](https://react.dev/learn/start-a-new-react-project). In fact, it was [reported](https://dev.to/ag2byte/create-react-app-is-officially-dead-h7o) to be removed from React's official documentation altogether. Instead, it recommends a litany of React frameworks with create-next-app at the top. Perhaps we can consider updating our React Roadmap to reflect those changes. 
### Feature DescriptionFor example, in the Service Mesh details section of the developer roadmap there is only a text description like: "Service Mesh, like the Istio open source project, is a way to control how parts different applications share data with each other".We can add images to the description of some other tasks like this "service mesh" task.
### Feature DescriptionCurrently, the roadmap editor can only create a completely new roadmap. I hope the roadmap editor can have using roadmap templates available from roadmap.sh to update new entries into the roadmaps according to personal preferences.
### Feature Descriptioni think it'll be great if you guys add resources about account abstraction. Thanks for such a huge work
### Roadmap URLhttps://roadmap.sh/backend### SuggestionsIn Backend road is a section where mixes Architeecture road and repeat the same information in both roads.

### Roadmap URLhttps://roadmap.sh### SuggestionsIntroducing a project at the end of a roadmap can be an effective way to create anticipation, engage stakeholders, and build excitement for the journey ahead. Here's an idea for incorporating a project introduction at the end of a roadmap:Concept: "The Grand Finale Project"Roadmap sections:1. Foundation Building: Start your roadmap by outlining the foundational steps and milestones that are necessary to prepare for the grand finale. This could include research, resource allocation, and team building.2. Progress and Milestones: As you move along the roadmap, showcase the incremental achievements and milestones reached. This section will create a sense of accomplishment and momentum.3. Challenges and Adaptations: Highlight any challenges or unexpected developments faced during the journey, along with the strategies used to overcome them. This adds a layer of transparency and learning.4. The Grand Finale Project Introduction: At this point, near the end of your roadmap, set the stage for your "Grand Finale Project." Here's how you can do it:    - Name and Teaser: Reveal the name of the project and provide a tantalizing teaser that sparks curiosity. For example, "Project X: The Ultimate Game-Changer. Get Ready for Something Big!"    - Objectives and Impact: Briefly describe the objectives of the project and the potential impact it can have. Explain how it aligns with the overarching goals and strategy.    - Key Features or Elements: Share a few key features, elements, or innovations that make this project special. This could be a new product, a game-changing process, or a transformative initiative.    - Timeline: Give a high-level estimate of when the project will kick off and its expected duration. This builds anticipation as stakeholders can look forward to a specific timeframe.    - Engagement Opportunities: Mention how various stakeholders can get involved or contribute to the success of the project. Whether it's through ideation sessions, cross-functional teams, or funding, make it clear how everyone can participate.5. Conclusion and Next Steps: Conclude the roadmap by summarizing the journey so far and transitioning into the "Grand Finale Project" phase. Outline the immediate next steps and encourage everyone to stay engaged and excited.By introducing the grand finale project at the end of the roadmap, you create a sense of climax and leave your audience eager to see the roadmap's conclusion. This approach not only informs stakeholders about the project but also makes them feel like they've been a part of an exciting journey, making them more invested in the final project's success.

### Roadmap URLhttps://roadmap.sh/ai-data-scientist### Suggestions### This issue is related to the issue #4579 that says there are broken links in the [AI/Data Scientist roadmap](https://roadmap.sh/ai-data-scientist) that are supposed to redirect to Coursera.I'll explain why both issues are related:### I worked on a fix for the issue #4579 and I created a pull request [here](https://github.com/kamranahmedse/developer-roadmap/pull/4600)So now in my branch all the links are working but I'm waiting for my commits to get merged so links become accessible "live".BUT... When I was fixing the links there was one named "Exploratory Data Analysis with Seaborn" that was redirecting into a "guided project" in Coursera, not a "course". And in the roadmap there was a "course" label for that link meaning the link you are about to click redirects to a course which is... not true!![2023-10-18 19_15_25-AI and Data Scientist Roadmap](https://github.com/kamranahmedse/developer-roadmap/assets/71039249/c54ea73d-c2d9-4e50-a19f-112cbe010ed8)This is where the link is supposed to redirect the user (when my pull request that i linked to above get accepted and commits get merged)![2023-10-18 19_28_48-Project_ Exploratory Data Analysis with Seaborn  1 5 hrs  _ Coursera](https://github.com/kamranahmedse/developer-roadmap/assets/71039249/8214c59e-7dfa-43b7-8091-4b36dfc01b01)So as you can see that's not a course, but a guided project. So that's why i am suggesting it would be better to change the "course" label into "project" or "guided project".I am open to work on that issue myself.

### Roadmap URLhttps://roadmap.sh/ux-design### SuggestionsThe methods found in the "Measuring the impact" are based on only quantitative methods but no qualitative ones which are crucial to understand the "why's" of metrics found in the qualitative analysis. To know more, check this link:https://www.nngroup.com/articles/quant-vs-qual/
### Roadmap URLhttps://roadmap.sh/cpp### SuggestionsIn the tab functions - operators, I think you mean the overloaded operators, and not just a explanation of the regular ones. Also, both those operators and the lambda functions should be a later topic, and not one of the very first, in my view at least.
### Roadmap URLhttps://roadmap.sh/docker### SuggestionsIf you go to the [docker roadmap](https://roadmap.sh/docker) and try to click on any of the buttons in the prerequisites section on the left (as seen on the preview below) none of the buttons are clickable or linking anywhere. ![2023-10-19 21_54_47-Window](https://github.com/kamranahmedse/developer-roadmap/assets/71039249/c7d82052-a127-435a-a750-ad224036c67d)If those have the same background color and style as the other clickable buttons so they are supposed to behave the same right? And they should show content.So I think content should be added in the same roadmap for each button:- package managers- users / groups permissions- shell commands- shell scripting- programming languages- application architecture
### Roadmap URLhttps://roadmap.sh/roadmaps### SuggestionsHello, thank you for creating this roadmap site. It has been incredibly helpful for my daily learning and has provided me with a clear goal for my journey towards becoming a developer.I would like to suggest an enhancement to the roadmap. How about adding tasks or project challenges at the end of each milestone? This would enable users to apply what they've learned and progressively develop their skills in each program step by step.This is my personal suggestion. Thank you for considering it. <3
### Roadmap URLhttps://roadmap.sh/frontend### SuggestionsThere should be a state managemnet tool like redux . like if we choose any javascript framework like React its better to learn a state management tool like redux or flux for the better optimized frontend web apps. Thanks!!

### Feature DescriptionI suggest a short description at the top of a roadmap explaining what the technology stands for, for example let's say UX design and a short description below it:User Experience (UX) design is a multidisciplinary approach to creating products, services, or systems that are user-centered and provide a seamless and enjoyable experience for the individuals using them. UX design involves understanding users' needs, behaviors, and preferences to design interfaces and interactions that are intuitive, efficient, and user-friendly. The goal of UX design is to enhance user satisfaction by making products easy to use, visually appealing, and effective in achieving their intended purpose. It encompasses research, prototyping, testing, and iterative design to ensure that the end result meets the needs and expectations of the users.
### Roadmap URLhttps://roadmap.sh/javascript### SuggestionsI've been using the roadmap on "roadmap.sh" to guide my learning journey in JavaScript, and I find it to be a valuable resource. While I appreciate the existing "prototypal inheritance" topic on the roadmap, it would be even more beneficial if this topic could be expanded to include additional subtopics and more in-depth content. Additionally, it would be great if the roadmap could include other aspects of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in JavaScript.
### Feature DescriptionI would like to request a suggestion for the creation of a study plan that can be translated into different languages, including Brazilian Portuguese (PT-BR). I believe that making this roadmap available in multiple languages would be of great assistance to a wide range of people, enabling them to access and learn from the provided content with ease.

### Feature DescriptionYou can also add some estimated time to complete a particular module , a rough estimation for a moderate level engineer , for beginners. Something which can help them to plan timeline. Right now , I don't know how much does it take to learn terraform. Providing a estimated time can boost the confidence of someone to learn skills.
### Roadmap URLhttps://roadmap.sh/computer-science### SuggestionsIn the section with the different types of Algorithms, I think it would be helpful to include a section on Dynamic Programming algorithms as well. I know it's mentioned in the Common Algorithms section, but its own section with examples (like how it is for Graph, Backtracking, Recursive, etc Algorithms) would be cool!

### Roadmap URLhttps://roadmap.sh/flutter### SuggestionsHello. I think Riverpod must be taken off the roadmap because it relies on anti-patterns. It's probably a bad idea to use global variables for state management and violate the dependency injection principle, both of which are on the roadmap. Check out my article on Riverpod too -> https://lazebny.io/riverpod.
### Roadmap URLhttps://roadmap.sh/python### SuggestionsI think, need to add some IDE, for example VSC and PyCharm.

### Roadmap URLhttps://roadmap.sh/cyber-security### Suggestions**Mr.  Kamran Ahmed**Hello! My name is Gustavo Martinelli, and I specialize in Governance, Risks, and Compliance. I hold degrees in both Law and Computer Science, and I am also a practicing lawyer. Currently, I am working as a Risk Analyst specializing in Cybersecurity Risks at a company.Going straight to the point, a Cybersecurity Expert needs to understand key concepts of cyberlaw. For example, if personal data is transmitted through the payload field of a JWT token, it may violate regulations such as the GDPR or CCPA. Therefore, acquiring a fundamental understanding of cyberlaw is essential for correctly collecting evidence in forensic activities.Should you decide to take on this issue, I would be more than willing to assist in drafting the explanation.Best regards,Gustavo Martinelli

I hold degrees in both Law and Computer Science, and I am also a practicing lawyer. Currently, I am working as a Risk Analyst specializing in Cybersecurity Risks at a company.Regarding security in blockchain, I've noticed that there is no dedicated topic in the Cybersecurity roadmap, whereas the Blockchain Developer roadmap includes a section on Security. I believe it would be beneficial to include a similar topic in the Cybersecurity roadmap as well.Best regards,Gustavo Martinelli
### Roadmap URLhttps://roadmap.sh/android### SuggestionsWith the official release of Jetpack Compose, this roadmap should encourage developers to learn the new UI framework as opposed to the legacy classes and views expected of a XML/viewbinding implementationFor example, consider a LazyColumn over a RecyclerView/Adapter pattern, a TextField over a EditText and a Text composable over a TextView. This new UI framework conforms to the latest material design principles and is the approach Google is now advocating on all their Android developer docs.In terms of patterns, lets remove MVC, most apps nowaways would be MVVM/MVI with some legacy apps using MVP. I guess it wiuld be a good idea to review current trends and adjust this roadmap to align with them
### Roadmap URLhttps://roadmap.sh/react-native### SuggestionsSome of the example code in React-Native Roadmap are using class components(ex: Animations, deep linking...)I think they should be rewritten to functional component because it's preferred in React and are more compatible with hooks.I'd like to work on this issue if we should rewrite them, thanks
### Roadmap URLhttps://roadmap.sh/devops### SuggestionsI would suggest adding Bitbucket pipelines to "Learn some CI/CD tools"
### Roadmap URLhttps://roadmap.sh/rust### Suggestions- SQLx does not actually support MSSQL officially anymore after the release of 0.7 due to it requiring licenses, which you can find more about on the GitHub repo [now that they've updated it.](https://www.github.com/launchbadge/sqlx). Launchbadge (who own SQLx) want to have some kind of paid product offering for it - this should probably be noted somewhere.As an aside: I'm slightly surprised the Axum framework isn't on here given it's supported by the Tokio team.Otherwise, great work on the roadmap!
### Roadmap URLhttps://roadmap.sh/game-developer### SuggestionsIn terms of video game programming, the guide is excellent. However, I'd recommend either renaming it to something like "Game Programmer" or adding content that pertains to game design. The title is slightly misleading as game design is a multidisciplinary field that requires much more than just programming. 
### Roadmap URLhttps://roadmap.sh/backend### Suggestionsyou can add fireship explanations to some topics,for example we have good explanation about dns and you can put this video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVR9lhUGAyU) there
### Roadmap URLhttps://roadmap.sh/game-developer### SuggestionsI personally recommend game devs to learn about C/C++ deeper, and build system, like cmake, it means, I suggest link the C++ career in game dev languages
### Detailed DescriptionHello Team,It would be great to add  CSS quiz questions along with Javascript and React questions. It will help to practice all of them in one place.I have created the top 30 CSS questions for practice. These questions include beginner and advanced questions.Let me know if can submit a pull request for the sameThank You
### Detailed DescriptionHello, I'm Andres, a Rails developer for a few years. Your platform is perfect; when I didn't know what else to learn, I came here. Now I notice that you have a resources section where people must do a PR to add a new resource. This is a good approach to help people continue learning things. But maybe it is hard to maintain? I see like 30 open PRs about resources. Some resource links change or just get removed, and you can't be tracking this all the time. By the way, I've been working on a little project myself that could lend a hand here. It's a platform for finding and sharing resources easily. Or at least, that's what I want to try. I've been including some features like filtering resource shares and categorizing them with the OpenAI API. Also, working on cronjobs to check if the resource is still alive and creating custom lists of resources.So, perhaps you could consider delegating the resource maintenance task to my app through custom resource lists, allowing you to concentrate on your primary goal of creating roadmaps.I leave an example list: https://resourc.tech/lists/ai-toolsPlease let me know if you find this idea interesting. If not, feel free to close this issueThank you for your time.
### Detailed Description[try, catch, finally, throw (video)](https://youtu.be/cftftueq-10)This video does not exist anymore
### Roadmap URLhttps://roadmap.sh/golang### SuggestionsUpdate the "Logging" section. The loggers displayed there are good, but there are better options. For example, instead of "Apex" or "Zap", it could be "[LAGRA](https://github.com/simplyYan/LAGRA)" instead, as it is a much easier and quicker option, with more comprehensive documentation. [LAGRA](https://github.com/simplyYan/LAGRA) is 8 times faster than the built-in "fmt" package and 2.29 times faster than "Zerolog". In addition, it is more customizable and its configuration requires only 2 fields ("log_file" which is mandatory and "log_level" which is unnecessary, since [LAGRA](https://github.com/simplyYan/LAGRA) makes it possible to define log levels dynamically). I recommend reviewing this, and providing something easier, faster, broader and lighter, [LAGRA](https://github.com/simplyYan/LAGRA) is certainly better than Apex or Zap.
### Roadmap URLhttps//:roadmap.sh### Suggestionsyou should either add Arrows to show the flow in which anyone should proceed learning or by any other means flow is important to learn in a systematic manner so it will be easy moving forward without any previous topic which occur in different part left out.
### Feature DescriptionNow that the list of "paths" is becoming large, I think there should be some kind of distinction between what is "Career Path" and what is "Technology Path": for example, "DevOps [Engineer]" is a job position for which you will need multiple technologies, while "Docker" is a single technology and by itself it probably won't be enough even to get a job in the IT sector.
### Roadmap URLhttps://roadmap.sh/devops### SuggestionsA DevOps Engineer should know something not just about serverless functions, but also about API Managment Platforms, like:- WSO2- AWS API Gateway- Azure API Management
### Roadmap URLhttps://roadmap.sh/devops### Suggestions"Caching Server" is too generic. A DevOps Engineer should know about:- Redis- Memcached- Varnish
### Roadmap URLhttps://roadmap.sh/devops### SuggestionsI would remove "Backend" from the list: it's another profession. Instead, I would add "System Design", that is actually quite related (https://roadmap.sh/system-design)
### Roadmap URLhttps://roadmap.sh/devops### Suggestions[Dynatrace](https://www.dynatrace.com/) is a large and popular application performance monitoring and automation service. It's also partnered with AWS, Azure, GCP, etc. I would consider Dynatrace to be similar to how Datadog is on the roadmap.
### Roadmap URLhttps://roadmap.sh/cyber-security### Suggestionsplease add youtube learning links to the roadmap for Eg where can we learn DDOS andother things also add links for people to download and install Linux and metasploit.
### Feature DescriptionWhen creating a custom roadmap and attempting to copy (`cmd/ctrl + C` or selecting `Copy` from the context menu) or cut (`cmd/ctrl + X` or selecting `Cut` from the context menu) a piece of text in the **Content & Links** panel, you may accidentally paste a block that you are describing.It would be much more intuitively clear for the user to have the ability to copy or cut text when working in the **Content & Links** panel using the aforementioned combinations.Meanwhile, when working in the **Properties** panel, the option to cut or paste blocks should remain available.

### What is the URL where the issue is happeninghttps://roadmap.sh/backend### What browsers are you seeing the problem on?_No response_### Describe the BugThe problem is in the general description of a service mesh.> In a service mesh, each microservice is typically represented by an instance of a lightweight, transparent proxy called an “envoy.” The envoys handle the communication between microservices and provide features such as load balancing, routing, and security.Considerations for the fix of the service mesh section:- In a service mesh microservice is represented by a sidecar proxy and the business logic itself (service/pod if we talk k8s).- `Envoy` is only an example of the sidecar proxy to choose from (for instance `Envoy` is used by Istio). Another example of the sidecar proxy is `micro-proxy` used by Linkerd service mesh. I suggest naming it just a proxy and not `Envoy`, otherwise it just indicates that `Envoy ` is always used.Service mesh source file: https://github.com/kamranahmedse/developer-roadmap/blob/master/src/data/roadmaps/backend/content/115-architectural-patterns/105-service-mesh.md### Output from browser console (if any)_No response_### Participation- [X] I am willing to submit a pull request for this issue.
### Roadmap URLhttps://roadmap.sh/postgresql-dba### Suggestions> The term “relational” comes from the fact that these tables can be related to one another through keys and relationships.Isn't actually come form **relational algebra**? from a math point of view, that base on sets theory? not from the idea of tables relationships itself... if I understand correctly.

### Roadmap URLhttps://roadmap.sh/technical-writer### SuggestionsTechnical writing has evolved over time and companies are constantly adopting DITA and XML Framework. I think the roadmap right now is missing any information related to DITA or Structured Writing. The technical writing roadmap is way more focused technical content writing rather than technical writing. So maybe adding DITA and other forms of Structured writing would really benefit the budding technical writers.

### Roadmap URLhttps://roadmap.sh/backend### SuggestionsI think that a webhook is an important topic to know if you are an backend engineering
### Roadmap URLhttps://roadmap.sh/ai-data-scientist### SuggestionsThere's a way to mark down the areas the you already Know
### Roadmap URLall roadmaps### SuggestionsThe url doesn't change when you click an item on a roadmap.It would be handy to be able to permalink to a topic so that you can share with others a specific area of knowledge, containing the description and links to content.Surely this will generate a bunch more traffic and SEO for the site as people share not just roadmaps, but the specific content within it.My personal use case is to be able to share internally in my org specifically the Spring MVC page on the Spring Boot Developer roadmap. Something like https://roadmap.sh/spring-boot/spring-mvcAll I can currently do is copy-paste the content, or point people to the roadmap.
### Roadmap URLhttps://roadmap.sh/flutter### SuggestionsIn the Flutter roadmap, there is a section named "SOLID Principles". I would like to suggest you add a YouTube tutorial whose link is this **https://youtu.be/XI7zep97c-Y?si=T1cjHpK1ETbKIg3y**. This tutorial is really amazing and has explained the concept in a very easy and understandable manner.
### Roadmap URLhttps://roadmap.sh/game-developer### SuggestionsAs it seems to me personally from the experience of working with friends, a link to a roadmap for 3d design or a description of work in any program (Blender, Cinema 4D, etc) together with a guide for choosing a style (this was an EXTREMELY big problem in our team ":D). And node about blockout would be extremely useful and important. Level design is being built on it.
### Roadmap URLhttps://roadmap.sh/rust### Suggestions(gpt translate)Hello! I didn’t notice any logging in the Rust roadmap. Unfortunately, I’m a beginner and can’t suggest anything specific, but I’m sure that logging is a very important part for any language. Thank you!

### Roadmap URLhttps://roadmap.sh/computer-science### SuggestionsI think there could be a bigger color difference between a section that is Pending and one that is Done ![image](https://github.com/kamranahmedse/developer-roadmap/assets/122545766/6f3e25e0-7b68-4fa0-a208-30aa803a59ee)This is just an idea, but I think it could be somewhere along these lines![image](https://github.com/kamranahmedse/developer-roadmap/assets/122545766/ab63b382-8a9f-4f10-acff-16c7428014c7)Since blue is the color used for the line that leads the user throughout the roadmap like a path, the section that the user has completed could also be blue, to represent how he has already crossed that pathTo be honest, I don't really like the light blue I chose for the "pending" option so that could be another color, but I also think that the gray color could be used to represent a section that the user has chosen to skipSince the main page of the roadmap uses blue, purple, shades and blue and white, I always thought that the yellow accents used on the roadmaps themselves were a bit off, so these are my suggestions.The dark blue I used is #3b82f6The gray I used is #777777
### Roadmap URLhttps://roadmap.sh/python### SuggestionsI think it can offer about multi thread, multi processing, asyncio...

### Roadmap URLhttps://roadmap.sh/ai-data-scientist### SuggestionsI would like to suggest that you add checkbox on each subsection. This will help keep users more motivated every time they check off what they've done.For example: instead of one checkbox like this (image below), we **add 3 more checkboxes** next to each course.![Screenshot 2023-11-29 at 11 39 36 AM](https://github.com/kamranahmedse/developer-roadmap/assets/34526907/2a2a4ec4-cffa-40a6-9ce4-6844275fbf43)
### What is the URL where the issue is happeninghttps://roadmap.sh/### What browsers are you seeing the problem on?Firefox### Describe the BugAfter signing up, on the homepage - 'Start learning' there are two full-points. I think those two full-points should not be there.

### Feature DescriptionI think it would be relevant to also study how any language has a different way of thinking code structure and idiomatic ways to do stuff, so it would be nice to see some content coming from Google style guide and Effective Gohttps://google.github.io/styleguide/go/guidehttps://go.dev/doc/effective_go
### Roadmap URLhttps://roadmap.sh/devops### SuggestionsIt seems odd to me that most people forget about a great, ubiquitously present multi-purpose multi-language script enhancer, called `make`.GNU Make is literally everywhere, or can be installed at little to no cost on many systems and architecture types.A proficient `Makefile`s author can benefit by using them1. to automate anything that requires typing2. to automate of building (or provisioning) virtually anything, not just C/C++ code3. to simplify scripting, e.g. by tracking dependencies and skipping not needed steps, etc.Makefiles can be used directly, or as part of pipelines, your imagination is basically the limit here.Therefore I dare to suggest that you at least mention make / Makefiles in the DevOps roadmap, e.g. as an optional enhancement, possibly next to the `Scripting` section, however, any task group can be augmented with a Makefile.Feel free to ignore this suggestion, keep up the good work, and thank you for the roadmap.sh project, which is great.

Hi there,I think these commits would help in cleaning/polishing the roadmap for developers working related to DevOps. For SSH + Port Forwarding, imo its one of the most underrated topic but yet it came up quite often in real life. This also including techniques like bastion hosts, DMZ management, etc.Apart from above, the rest are just clean ups.> Sorry for adding a lot of items into one PRFrom 8adc84d6f7eaa7b0c27605906590b87717cb7c39- Added SSH + Port Forwarding into Network and Security section- Fixed "Cloud Formation" -> Should be "CloudFormation"- Added Prometheus and small caption on its usage- Added missing link to File Systems- Adjust textbox position - fix misalignmentsAlso close #520 

In Understand the concepts under Javascript Basics, I wondered whether "Hosting" meant "Hoisting".  So I'm proposing this amendment.
new frontend image file in image folder and edited frontend.json file in projects folder
I've added a browser category to reduce "basic javascript" category and leave space to browser specific api'sI've added webcomponents api's in browser category
In the Devops roadmap | Configuration Management, to change Puppe => Puppet
Our DevOps is also responsible for both RDBMS and No-SQL DBs. Could include specific databses (MySQL, Postgres, Oracle, MSSQL, etc.) and Infrastructure-as-Code (Flyway, Liquibase).
[Instana](https://www.instana.com) is a great service for Application and Hardware Monitoring.
Mainly to replace "push push" with "push", but then to clean up for alignment too. The nature of the json file (all one line) makes the diff awkward, I'm afraid, but I've tested this in Balsamiq and it looks good.
update
I created a full translation in pt-br of this roadmaps and I'm adding a sector of links in the README.md to others translations. Let´s make this a global project!  
Hi, Kamran.I took the liberty of doing a translation of your roadmap in Brazilian Portuguese and I am sending a pull request to approve it who knows in a separate branch. I will also open an issue so that other Brazilians can contribute with improvements and corrections.Thanks! ^^
I believe `hoising` was meant in this context

Hi,I translated your roadmap to Arabic,but not sure what the right way to merge this
Remove JSCS ([deprecated](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jscs)) and add [StandardJS](https://standardjs.com/) linter.
in order to - todevops - DevOpsanyway - any waybetter suited - better be suited

- [x] Adds a note and links the Backend and DevOps roadmaps- [x] Adds List Comprehension and Generator Expressions under "Advanced Topics"- [x] Adds different programming paradigms under "Advanced Topics"- [x] Adds Conda under the Package Managers - [x] Rearranges some items 
Infrastructure monitoring tool - prometheus is used very prominently by most of the companies as it helps monitor multiple metrics using a single agent called exporter. I think adding prometheus would be apt as this is one of a kind in this list.
According to issue #625, SASS shouldn't be referenced as SASS, but as Sass.
Add network tool "netstat"; add Web server "Jetty";add cloud provider "Alibaba Cloud"; add Infrastructure Monitoring "Prometheus"

I highly value your work, it helped me to get a better overview when I started out to learn Web Development. The first acknowledgment did confuse me a little bit though. I did not discuss this contribution with anyone, since my understanding was that you're looking for active help adding content to the Roadmaps [issue #985]. Also the guidelines did not mention the first acknowledgment. So, hopefully not causing any issues.Regarding the contribution: the added resource helped me several times to find a) a starting point on how to build an accessible web experience regarding a specific component and b) provides usually links with in-depth examples.

It contains a DNS-server-in-your-browser. Where every visitor gets their own DNS server at a dynamic subdomain and they can create DNS entries, view request logs, etc. There's also a guided little tutorial in the sidebar.IMO its a **fantastic** resource for simply experimenting with and seeing what a DNS server is and what they do! Such a great learning resource!

## ReasonI believe that including match-case control flow to the conditionals node would be highly valuable for new learners without being cumbersome. Match-case is highly expressive and readable, and may be preferred over an if-elif-else statement in some situations. Match-case can do things that if-elif-else cannot, it can also make it easier to reason about and read conditonal logic for a program. For that reason I've added a single quality how-to article on the subject and amended the description to include it.## ExampleFrom the Python docs:```python# point is an (x, y) tuplematch point:    case (0, 0):        print("Origin")    case (0, y):        print(f"Y={y}")    case (x, 0):        print(f"X={x}")    case (x, y):        print(f"X={x}, Y={y}")    case _:        raise ValueError("Not a point")```From the article:```pythondef file_handler_v1(command):    match command.split():        case ['show']:            print('List all files and directories: ')            # code to list files        case ['remove', *files]:            print('Removing files: {}'.format(files))            # code to remove files        case _:            print('Command not recognized')```## Changes* Added a link for a how-to on the subject* Corrected grammar mistakes* Changed text to include MATCH-CASE

I have implemented dark mode to the project.I decided to use colours from the home screen for a dark mode palette.Disclaimer: Because roadmap.sh uses SSG, there is no way to set users previously chosen theme without JS running after initial render. This causes flickering if user chooses to use theme other than the one configured on default. Because of this issue, I decided to make dark mode a default option (maybe I'm biased, but in my experience more users prefer dark mode).Flicker white -> dark  is way worse than dark -> white. In my opinion It's not a very big issue.This issue would be resolved if roadmap.sh could use SSR instead of raw SSG. But this is a decision to be made by maintainers, not me. I wanted to provide the best user experience with the product that we have today.Couple of screens below: ![home_page](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/65770405/215145534-017a6061-eb15-4fd3-8f62-94fb7d669d44.png)![roadmap_example](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/65770405/215145658-6c86bc4f-44e9-494e-9168-fe7e5eeb48ea.png)

- The database indexing resource should be included because it is one of the best and most commended videos on youtube. It breaks down the concept so that everyone (juniors and seniors) can understand it. I personally used it three years ago and I still use it with all my mentees.- ~~Even though we have new authentication protocols, SAML is an important building block in some enterprise architectures. We should have information available for individuals looking to understand what it's all about~~. Update:I noticed that the SAML part of the roadmap had been updated 2 months after my PR and so I canceled that part of the comment

### DescriptionThis PR updates the content for the Promises by fixing a syntax error in the example. The original docs mistakenly used `newPromise()` instead of `new Promise()`, which caused a syntax error when initialising a new Promise.To resolve this issue, the docs was updated to correctly use `new Promise()` with a space between new and Promise.### Changes Made- Replaced `newPromise()` with `new Promise()` in the example.

Add a link to a video that explains about the internet and I found it very educational. It is also explained by one of the fathers of the internet, Vinton Cerf. I think it's a good idea to have a video like that for people who are new to the internet.

I noticed this typo while viewing the roadmap today and decided to submit a PR to fix it.I also took the liberty to format the docker.json file to allow more easy reviews in the future. Without this, it's not easy to search for the changes because the whole docker.json file is in just one line. I have noticed that the frontend.json file is formatted but others aren't, so if there's a reason for them please let me know so I can revert this change.And thanks for the awesome project, it's been really helpful.

This resolves issue #4110.As, the issue states, the link under the contributing.md docs was broken. It was linking to```https://github.com/kamranahmedse/developer-roadmap/tree/master/public/jsons```instead of```https://github.com/kamranahmedse/developer-roadmap/tree/master/src/data/roadmaps```
When cloned, the resulting download size is about 1.7gb due to the history associated with the repository. A way to get around this is to use the `depth` parameter along with the `clone` command. So the resulting command should look like```shgit clone --depth=1 https://github.com/kamranahmedse/developer-roadmap.git```This reduces the download size by a lot. The total number of objects goes from 47000 to 5000.This has been mentioned somewhere in the readme so that contributors do not end up downloading such a large sized repository with mostly unneeded history. 
Added Buddy CI/CD to Devops and article about Buddy to Backend > CI/CD.
Fixes #3982- Updated link to **Error Boundary** from React documentation. [Error Boundaries in React](https://reactjs.org/docs/error-boundaries.html) -> [Error Boundaries in React](https://react.dev/reference/react/Component#catching-rendering-errors-with-an-error-boundary)- Actualized article about **JSX** and links to React documentation. Removed old [Introduction to JSX](https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html) and added [JavaScript in JSX with Curly Braces](https://react.dev/learn/javascript-in-jsx-with-curly-braces) in addition to [Writing markup with JSX]- Updated description of **React Component Lifecycle** and changed the link from deprecated [The Component Lifecycle](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-component.html#the-component-lifecycle) to [Class Component](https://react.dev/reference/react/Component)- Added few words about HOC's. But kept the link to the old documentation, because the new one does not even mention thisThere are still 3 links to the old documntation, because there is no alternative in the new one:- [Composition vs Inheritance](https://reactjs.org/docs/composition-vs-inheritance.html)- [High-Order Components](https://reactjs.org/docs/higher-order-components.html)- [AJAX and APIs](https://reactjs.org/docs/faq-ajax.html)

Beam size is a hyperparameter used in decoding strategies, particularly in the context of sequence generation tasks, such as language modeling and machine translation. It determines the number of candidate sequences the model considers during the generation process. A larger beam size means the model keeps track of more possible sequences, while a smaller beam size limits the number of candidates. Beam search is a common decoding strategy that utilizes this hyperparameter.[Watch out for your beam search hyperparameters](https://benjaminmarie.com/watch-out-for-your-beam-search-hyperparameters/)[What is Beam Search? Explaining The Beam Search Algorithm](https://www.width.ai/post/what-is-beam-search)
Beam search is probably the most popular decoding algorithm for language generation tasks.It keeps at each time step, i.e., for each new token generated, the k most probable hypotheses, according to the model used for inference, and the remaining ones are discarded.Finally, at the end of the decoding, the hypothesis with the highest probability will be the output.[What is Beam Search?

I added a link to the channel that searches for CompTIA A+ 220-1101 on Professor Messer's channel.
### Description- Whilst following the React roadmap, the first link under "Functional Components" that points to `https://react.dev/reference/react/component`, should instead point to `https://react.dev/reference/react/components`, otherwise the user will be met with a "Not Found" page.
instanceof is a runtime check and interface and types don't exist during runtime.Also TypeScript has a structural type system, which means that they are matched according to the structure of the object and types - not according to instances.For example:interface Person {    name: string;    age: number}const person = {    name: "Ken",    age: 25}if (person instanceof Person) // Error
The syntax for Function Expression was incorrect. It was an example of a function declared using Function Declaration.

When you try to use these function templates, there can be ambiguity issues. If you call foo with an arithmetic type, both template overloads will be considered valid, and the compiler won't know which one to choose.To solve this problem, you need to use SFINAE with more complex conditions inside a single function definition.

fixes #4223fixes #4386The issue is related to AppDynamics under Application Monitoring. When we click on AppDynamic it takes us to the following URL:https://roadmap.sh/devops/monitoring/application-monitoring/app-dynamicsBut the correct URL is as follows:https://roadmap.sh/devops/application-monitoring/app-dynamicsThis can be fixed in the JSON file, but we are not updating the JSON files due to implementing the Roadmap editor. One more thing that is not implemented correctly is when fetching topic detail, If we get an error we are setting the error to Topic not found but we are not hiding the loader and there is not content to be shown if some error occurs. Also, we are not resetting the error to empty due to which after an error occurs no new topic can be opened and it stays in the loading state.I have tried an implementation for exception management that will notify the user of the issue and the user will be able to view other topics even when some topic has an issue.Attached is a simple error message page.![image](https://github.com/kamranahmedse/developer-roadmap/assets/43681543/aac453a4-a57f-4e58-a688-b55ba13c5c28)

The files with broken links are the following:- [classic-advanced-ml](https://github.com/kamranahmedse/developer-roadmap/blob/b06e82de5f351045f93e63e4449a08a85e5825ce/src/data/roadmaps/ai-data-scientist/content/classic-advanced-ml.md)- [data-understanding](https://github.com/kamranahmedse/developer-roadmap/blob/b06e82de5f351045f93e63e4449a08a85e5825ce/src/data/roadmaps/ai-data-scientist/content/data-understanding.md)- [deployment-models](https://github.com/kamranahmedse/developer-roadmap/blob/b06e82de5f351045f93e63e4449a08a85e5825ce/src/data/roadmaps/ai-data-scientist/content/deployment-models.md)- [diff-calculus](https://github.com/kamranahmedse/developer-roadmap/blob/b06e82de5f351045f93e63e4449a08a85e5825ce/src/data/roadmaps/ai-data-scientist/content/diff-calculus.md)- [fully-connected-nn](https://github.com/kamranahmedse/developer-roadmap/blob/b06e82de5f351045f93e63e4449a08a85e5825ce/src/data/roadmaps/ai-data-scientist/content/fully-connected-nn.md)- [hypothesis-testing](https://github.com/kamranahmedse/developer-roadmap/blob/b06e82de5f351045f93e63e4449a08a85e5825ce/src/data/roadmaps/ai-data-scientist/content/hypothesis-testing.md)- [learn-dsa](https://github.com/kamranahmedse/developer-roadmap/blob/b06e82de5f351045f93e63e4449a08a85e5825ce/src/data/roadmaps/ai-data-scientist/content/learn-dsa.md)- [linear-algebra-calc-mathana](https://github.com/kamranahmedse/developer-roadmap/blob/b06e82de5f351045f93e63e4449a08a85e5825ce/src/data/roadmaps/ai-data-scientist/content/linear-algebra-calc-mathana.md)- [probability-sampling](https://github.com/kamranahmedse/developer-roadmap/blob/b06e82de5f351045f93e63e4449a08a85e5825ce/src/data/roadmaps/ai-data-scientist/content/probability-sampling.md)- [regression-time-series-fitting-distr](https://github.com/kamranahmedse/developer-roadmap/blob/b06e82de5f351045f93e63e4449a08a85e5825ce/src/data/roadmaps/ai-data-scientist/content/regression-time-series-fitting-distr.md)- [stats-clt](https://github.com/kamranahmedse/developer-roadmap/blob/b06e82de5f351045f93e63e4449a08a85e5825ce/src/data/roadmaps/ai-data-scientist/content/stats-clt.md)Here is a preview of some of the changes I made ![2023-10-18 16_49_35-Comparing kamranahmedse_master AmineAouragh_broken-coursera-links · kamranahme](https://github.com/kamranahmedse/developer-roadmap/assets/71039249/0405b606-a2f0-4635-896d-d24fb03c16b8)
fix contributing doc link
This pull request and the #4600 pull request should have been one pull request instead of twoI'll explain:So I thought all I had to work on is issue #4603 and to fix that issue I should apply changes to the ai-data-scientist.json file but while I was working on it I found out that in the same file there were broken links included. I thought I fixed them [here](https://github.com/kamranahmedse/developer-roadmap/pull/4600) but what I fixed are only the links under the roadmaps/ai-data-scientist/content/ directory but what I didn't know is that they were also mentioned in the JSON file in roadmaps/ai-data-scientist/ai-data-scientist.json - something I should have paid attention to.Here is a preview of one of the 14 links I fixed in the JSON file![2023-10-18 20_36_12-fixed a text property and external links · kamranahmedse_developer-roadmap@d84e8](https://github.com/kamranahmedse/developer-roadmap/assets/71039249/8fad0f15-6b1d-47d0-a77e-83683be2b6a8)and here is a preview of how I changed the "Course" label into "Project" for the "Exploratory Data Analysis Seaborn" link since the link redirects to a project not a course.![2023-10-18 20_44_10-fixed a text property and external links · kamranahmedse_developer-roadmap@d84e8](https://github.com/kamranahmedse/developer-roadmap/assets/71039249/6f8672cc-2f82-40b8-9da7-c8d9cbe4cfe4)
## Issue reference & explanationThis is a fix to the issue #4606 saying there is an error in the [MongoDB roadmap](https://roadmap.sh/mongodb) where an operator $currentDate (used to set the value of a field into the current date) is used in an insertOne() CRUD operation which is not correct according to this [mongodb source](https://database.guide/mongodb-currentdate/#:~:text=In%20MongoDB%2C%20the%20%24currentDate%20operator,be%20used%20in%20upsert%20operations) - the $currentDate can ONLY be used in an update() method and upsert() method.## Details about changes:I changed the text and the CRUD operation from 'InsertOne' to 'Update'## Here is a preview:![2023-10-19 11_56_05-Window](https://github.com/kamranahmedse/developer-roadmap/assets/71039249/cd35c00f-ccf8-44ab-9768-1038432eb125)
According to the issue #4580 the React roadmap still has create-react-app as a React CLI tool to create new React projects. But as of now the React team no longer recommends using create-react-app but instead recommends picking one of the React-powered frameworks popular in the community like Next.js so i updated the React CLI to create-next-app.

Improved code_of_conduct.md more grammatically and apt.
Fix 1- when user mark Query Operators as Done it makes Performance Optimization as Done also 2- when user click on "Performance Optimization" it opened "Query Operators" side panel (we don't have content for Performance Optimization) 3- split Performance Optimization into another folder called 105-performance-optimization before it was under 105-query-operators
it should resolve this issue #4606 Before![image](https://github.com/kamranahmedse/developer-roadmap/assets/74682593/da882c7c-67f2-45eb-8e68-df914e45220f)After![image](https://github.com/kamranahmedse/developer-roadmap/assets/74682593/f5c37186-bb91-41eb-a756-0f55f9634270)

The statement, "It is a collection of elements where each element is stored as a value without any keys," is slightly ambiguous. It's important to clarify that while `Set` does not use keys in the way that an `Object` or `Map` does, each element in a Set can be thought of as both a key and a value, which is distinct from how keys and values are defined in objects or maps.
