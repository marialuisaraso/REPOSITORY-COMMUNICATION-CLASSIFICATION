Hi there,I think these commits would help in cleaning/polishing the roadmap for developers working related to DevOps. For SSH + Port Forwarding, imo its one of the most underrated topic but yet it came up quite often in real life. This also including techniques like bastion hosts, DMZ management, etc.Apart from above, the rest are just clean ups.> Sorry for adding a lot of items into one PRFrom 8adc84d6f7eaa7b0c27605906590b87717cb7c39- Added SSH + Port Forwarding into Network and Security section- Fixed "Cloud Formation" -> Should be "CloudFormation"- Added Prometheus and small caption on its usage- Added missing link to File Systems- Adjust textbox position - fix misalignmentsAlso close #520 

In Understand the concepts under Javascript Basics, I wondered whether "Hosting" meant "Hoisting".  So I'm proposing this amendment.
new frontend image file in image folder and edited frontend.json file in projects folder
I've added a browser category to reduce "basic javascript" category and leave space to browser specific api'sI've added webcomponents api's in browser category
In the Devops roadmap | Configuration Management, to change Puppe => Puppet

[Instana](https://www.instana.com) is a great service for Application and Hardware Monitoring.
Mainly to replace "push push" with "push", but then to clean up for alignment too. The nature of the json file (all one line) makes the diff awkward, I'm afraid, but I've tested this in Balsamiq and it looks good.
update
I created a full translation in pt-br of this roadmaps and I'm adding a sector of links in the README.md to others translations. Let´s make this a global project!  
Hi, Kamran.I took the liberty of doing a translation of your roadmap in Brazilian Portuguese and I am sending a pull request to approve it who knows in a separate branch. I will also open an issue so that other Brazilians can contribute with improvements and corrections.Thanks! ^^
I believe `hoising` was meant in this context

As ELK Stack is renamed to Elastic Stack i updated devops-map.json
It is "Go" (and not Golang).
Hi,I translated your roadmap to Arabic,but not sure what the right way to merge this
Remove JSCS ([deprecated](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jscs)) and add [StandardJS](https://standardjs.com/) linter.
in order to - todevops - DevOpsanyway - any waybetter suited - better be suited

- [x] Adds a note and links the Backend and DevOps roadmaps- [x] Adds List Comprehension and Generator Expressions under "Advanced Topics"- [x] Adds different programming paradigms under "Advanced Topics"- [x] Adds Conda under the Package Managers - [x] Rearranges some items 
Infrastructure monitoring tool - prometheus is used very prominently by most of the companies as it helps monitor multiple metrics using a single agent called exporter. I think adding prometheus would be apt as this is one of a kind in this list.
According to issue #625, SASS shouldn't be referenced as SASS, but as Sass.
Add network tool "netstat"; add Web server "Jetty";add cloud provider "Alibaba Cloud"; add Infrastructure Monitoring "Prometheus"

I highly value your work, it helped me to get a better overview when I started out to learn Web Development. The first acknowledgment did confuse me a little bit though. I did not discuss this contribution with anyone, since my understanding was that you're looking for active help adding content to the Roadmaps [issue #985]. Also the guidelines did not mention the first acknowledgment. So, hopefully not causing any issues.Regarding the contribution: the added resource helped me several times to find a) a starting point on how to build an accessible web experience regarding a specific component and b) provides usually links with in-depth examples.

It contains a DNS-server-in-your-browser. Where every visitor gets their own DNS server at a dynamic subdomain and they can create DNS entries, view request logs, etc. There's also a guided little tutorial in the sidebar.IMO its a **fantastic** resource for simply experimenting with and seeing what a DNS server is and what they do! Such a great learning resource!

- Update JavaScript expressions and operators

I started to make the node.js content in this fork.

- Update JavaScript's strict mode

This PR adds You Don't Know JS Yet, a book series by Kyle Simpson diving deep into the core mechanisms of the JavaScript language.The book series is fully available on GitHub for free and has 6 volumes, two of them in its second edition.

## ReasonI believe that including match-case control flow to the conditionals node would be highly valuable for new learners without being cumbersome. Match-case is highly expressive and readable, and may be preferred over an if-elif-else statement in some situations. Match-case can do things that if-elif-else cannot, it can also make it easier to reason about and read conditonal logic for a program. For that reason I've added a single quality how-to article on the subject and amended the description to include it.## ExampleFrom the Python docs:```python# point is an (x, y) tuplematch point:    case (0, 0):        print("Origin")    case (0, y):        print(f"Y={y}")    case (x, 0):        print(f"X={x}")    case (x, y):        print(f"X={x}, Y={y}")    case _:        raise ValueError("Not a point")```From the article:```pythondef file_handler_v1(command):    match command.split():        case ['show']:            print('List all files and directories: ')            # code to list files        case ['remove', *files]:            print('Removing files: {}'.format(files))            # code to remove files        case _:            print('Command not recognized')```## Changes* Added a link for a how-to on the subject* Corrected grammar mistakes* Changed text to include MATCH-CASE

I have implemented dark mode to the project.I decided to use colours from the home screen for a dark mode palette.Disclaimer: Because roadmap.sh uses SSG, there is no way to set users previously chosen theme without JS running after initial render. This causes flickering if user chooses to use theme other than the one configured on default. Because of this issue, I decided to make dark mode a default option (maybe I'm biased, but in my experience more users prefer dark mode).Flicker white -> dark  is way worse than dark -> white. In my opinion It's not a very big issue.This issue would be resolved if roadmap.sh could use SSR instead of raw SSG. But this is a decision to be made by maintainers, not me. I wanted to provide the best user experience with the product that we have today.Couple of screens below: ![home_page](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/65770405/215145534-017a6061-eb15-4fd3-8f62-94fb7d669d44.png)![roadmap_example](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/65770405/215145658-6c86bc4f-44e9-494e-9168-fe7e5eeb48ea.png)

### DescriptionThis PR updates the content for the Promises by fixing a syntax error in the example. The original docs mistakenly used `newPromise()` instead of `new Promise()`, which caused a syntax error when initialising a new Promise.To resolve this issue, the docs was updated to correctly use `new Promise()` with a space between new and Promise.### Changes Made- Replaced `newPromise()` with `new Promise()` in the example.

Add a link to a video that explains about the internet and I found it very educational. It is also explained by one of the fathers of the internet, Vinton Cerf. I think it's a good idea to have a video like that for people who are new to the internet.

I noticed this typo while viewing the roadmap today and decided to submit a PR to fix it.I also took the liberty to format the docker.json file to allow more easy reviews in the future. Without this, it's not easy to search for the changes because the whole docker.json file is in just one line. I have noticed that the frontend.json file is formatted but others aren't, so if there's a reason for them please let me know so I can revert this change.And thanks for the awesome project, it's been really helpful.

This resolves issue #4110.As, the issue states, the link under the contributing.md docs was broken. It was linking to```https://github.com/kamranahmedse/developer-roadmap/tree/master/public/jsons```instead of```https://github.com/kamranahmedse/developer-roadmap/tree/master/src/data/roadmaps```
When cloned, the resulting download size is about 1.7gb due to the history associated with the repository. A way to get around this is to use the `depth` parameter along with the `clone` command. So the resulting command should look like```shgit clone --depth=1 https://github.com/kamranahmedse/developer-roadmap.git```This reduces the download size by a lot. The total number of objects goes from 47000 to 5000.This has been mentioned somewhere in the readme so that contributors do not end up downloading such a large sized repository with mostly unneeded history.

Beam size is a hyperparameter used in decoding strategies, particularly in the context of sequence generation tasks, such as language modeling and machine translation. It determines the number of candidate sequences the model considers during the generation process. A larger beam size means the model keeps track of more possible sequences, while a smaller beam size limits the number of candidates. Beam search is a common decoding strategy that utilizes this hyperparameter.[Watch out for your beam search hyperparameters](https://benjaminmarie.com/watch-out-for-your-beam-search-hyperparameters/)[What is Beam Search? Explaining The Beam Search Algorithm](https://www.width.ai/post/what-is-beam-search)
Beam search is probably the most popular decoding algorithm for language generation tasks.It keeps at each time step, i.e., for each new token generated, the k most probable hypotheses, according to the model used for inference, and the remaining ones are discarded.Finally, at the end of the decoding, the hypothesis with the highest probability will be the output.[What is Beam Search?

fixes #4223fixes #4386The issue is related to AppDynamics under Application Monitoring. When we click on AppDynamic it takes us to the following URL:https://roadmap.sh/devops/monitoring/application-monitoring/app-dynamicsBut the correct URL is as follows:https://roadmap.sh/devops/application-monitoring/app-dynamicsThis can be fixed in the JSON file, but we are not updating the JSON files due to implementing the Roadmap editor. One more thing that is not implemented correctly is when fetching topic detail, If we get an error we are setting the error to Topic not found but we are not hiding the loader and there is not content to be shown if some error occurs. Also, we are not resetting the error to empty due to which after an error occurs no new topic can be opened and it stays in the loading state.I have tried an implementation for exception management that will notify the user of the issue and the user will be able to view other topics even when some topic has an issue.Attached is a simple error message page.![image](https://github.com/kamranahmedse/developer-roadmap/assets/43681543/aac453a4-a57f-4e58-a688-b55ba13c5c28)

fix contributing doc link
This pull request and the #4600 pull request should have been one pull request instead of twoI'll explain:So I thought all I had to work on is issue #4603 and to fix that issue I should apply changes to the ai-data-scientist.json file but while I was working on it I found out that in the same file there were broken links included. I thought I fixed them [here](https://github.com/kamranahmedse/developer-roadmap/pull/4600) but what I fixed are only the links under the roadmaps/ai-data-scientist/content/ directory but what I didn't know is that they were also mentioned in the JSON file in roadmaps/ai-data-scientist/ai-data-scientist.json - something I should have paid attention to.Here is a preview of one of the 14 links I fixed in the JSON file![2023-10-18 20_36_12-fixed a text property and external links · kamranahmedse_developer-roadmap@d84e8](https://github.com/kamranahmedse/developer-roadmap/assets/71039249/8fad0f15-6b1d-47d0-a77e-83683be2b6a8)and here is a preview of how I changed the "Course" label into "Project" for the "Exploratory Data Analysis Seaborn" link since the link redirects to a project not a course.![2023-10-18 20_44_10-fixed a text property and external links · kamranahmedse_developer-roadmap@d84e8](https://github.com/kamranahmedse/developer-roadmap/assets/71039249/6f8672cc-2f82-40b8-9da7-c8d9cbe4cfe4)
## Issue reference & explanationThis is a fix to the issue #4606 saying there is an error in the [MongoDB roadmap](https://roadmap.sh/mongodb) where an operator $currentDate (used to set the value of a field into the current date) is used in an insertOne() CRUD operation which is not correct according to this [mongodb source](https://database.guide/mongodb-currentdate/#:~:text=In%20MongoDB%2C%20the%20%24currentDate%20operator,be%20used%20in%20upsert%20operations) - the $currentDate can ONLY be used in an update() method and upsert() method.## Details about changes:I changed the text and the CRUD operation from 'InsertOne' to 'Update'## Here is a preview:![2023-10-19 11_56_05-Window](https://github.com/kamranahmedse/developer-roadmap/assets/71039249/cd35c00f-ccf8-44ab-9768-1038432eb125)
According to the issue #4580 the React roadmap still has create-react-app as a React CLI tool to create new React projects. But as of now the React team no longer recommends using create-react-app but instead recommends picking one of the React-powered frameworks popular in the community like Next.js so i updated the React CLI to create-next-app.

The statement, "It is a collection of elements where each element is stored as a value without any keys," is slightly ambiguous. It's important to clarify that while `Set` does not use keys in the way that an `Object` or `Map` does, each element in a Set can be thought of as both a key and a value, which is distinct from how keys and values are defined in objects or maps.
