Match-case is highly expressive and readable, and may be preferred over an if-elif-else statement in some situations. Match-case can do things that if-elif-else cannot, it can also make it easier to reason about and read conditonal logic for a program. For that reason I\'ve added a single quality how-to article on the subject and amended the description to include it.\r\n\r\n## Example\r\nFrom the Python docs:\r\n```python\r\n# point is an (x, y) tuple\r\nmatch point:\r\n    case (0, 0):\r\n        print("Origin")\r\n    case (0, y):\r\n        print(f"Y={y}")\r\n    case (x, 0):\r\n        print(f"X={x}")\r\n    case (x, y):\r\n        print(f"X={x}, Y={y}")\r\n    case _:\r\n        raise ValueError("Not a point")\r\n```\r\n\r\nFrom the article:\r\n```python\r\ndef file_handler_v1(command):\r\n    match command.split():\r\n        case [\'show\']:\r\n            print(\'List all files and directories: \')\r\n            # code to list files\r\n        case [\'remove\', *files]:\r\n            print(\'Removing files: {}\'.format(files))\r\n            # code to remove files\r\n        case _:\r\n            print(\'Command not recognized\')\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n* Added a link for a how-to on the subject\r\n* Corrected grammar mistakes\r\n* Changed text to include MATCH-CASE'}, {'title': 'Revert "Removed Nodejs Error"', 'body': 'Reverts kamranahmedse/developer-roadmap#2341'}, {'title': 'Add Vitest content', 'body': ''}, {'title': 'Update 100-integration-testing.md', 'body': 'Fixed grammatical errors.
